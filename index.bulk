RULE 4 PLEADINGS, MOTIONS AND ORDERS A. Pleadings. There shall be a complaint and an answer; plus a responsive pleading shall be allowed when, by cross claim, counterclaim or otherwise, a party is first claimed against unless the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court shall otherwise order. The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court may grant additional leave to plead in the interest of narrowing and defining issues or as justice may require. B. Motions and Orders. (1) Motions: An application to the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court for an order shall be by motion and shall be in writing, unless made orally during a hearing or trial, and shall set forth the relief or order sought and the grounds therefore stated with particularity. A motion and notice of motion may be set forth together. (2) Orders: An order includes every direction of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court whether included in a judgment or not, and may be made with or without notice to adverse parties and may be vacated or modified with or without notice. (3) Hearing on Motions and Orders: A motion or hearing on an order shall be automatically continued if the Judge before whom it was to be heard is unable to hear it on the day specified and no other Judge is available to hear it. RULE 5 GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING A. Claims for Relief. A pleading, which sets forth, a claim for affirmative relief shall contain: (1) A short, plain statement of the grounds upon which the Court has jurisdiction; and (2) A short, plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and (3) A demand for judgment for the relief sought to which the pleader considers himself/herself entitled. Such claim for relief can be in the alternative or for several types of relief. B. Defenses and Denials. A party shall state in plain, concise terms the grounds, upon which he/she bases his/her defense to claims pleaded against him/her, and shall admit or deny the claims and statements upon which the adverse party relies. If he/she is without information or knowledge regarding a statement or claim, he/she shall so state and such shall be deemed to be a denial. Denials shall fairly meet the substance of the claims or statements denied, and may be made as to specified parts but not all of a claim, statement or averment. A general denial shall not be made unless the party could in good faith deny each and every claim covered thereby. A claim to which a responsive pleading is required, except for amount of damages, shall be deemed admitted unless denied; if no responsive pleading is allowed the claims of the adverse party shall be deemed denied. C. General Content of Claims and Defenses. Claims and defenses shall be simply, concisely, and directly stated, but may be in alternative or hypothetical form, on one or several counts or defenses, need not be consistent with one another, and may be based on legal or equitable grounds or both. D. Affirmative Defenses. Matters constituting an affirmative defense or avoidance shall be affirmatively set forth. When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or vice versa, the Court may treat the pleading as if it had been properly designated if justice so requires. E. Construction of Pleadings. All pleading shall be construed so as to do substantial justice. RULE 6 FORMS FOR PLEADINGS A. Caption. Every pleading shall contain a caption heading, the name of the Court, the Title of the action, the Court case number (if known) and a designation as to what kind of pleading it is. The title of the complaint must name all parties; the title of other pleadings, after naming the first party on each side, may refer generally to other parties. B. Paragraphs. All averments of claim or defense shall be set forth in separate numbered paragraphs each of which is limited, as nearly as possible, to a single circumstance. Claims or defenses founded upon separate transactions or occurrences should be set forth in separate counts or defenses. C. Exhibits: Adoption by Reference. Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. A copy of a written instrument, which is an exhibit to a pleading, is a part thereof for all purposes. D. Paper Used in Pleadings. Insofar as is possible, pleadings and other papers filed in any action shall be on letter size paper, double spaced, except for matters customarily single spaced, contain at least a 1-inch margin on all sides, and contain the Court file number on the first page thereof. Substantial compliance with this rule will be sufficient for all parties not represented by a professional attorney. RULE 7 DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS A. When Presented. A defendant or other party against whom a claim has been made for affirmative relief shall have twenty (20) days from the date of service upon him/her to answer or respond to the claim. B. Motions. Motions to dismiss or to make opposing parties' pleadings more definite may be made prior to answering a claim and an answer will not be due until ten (10) days after the disposition of the motion by the Court. RULE 8 COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS CLAIM A. Counterclaim. A party against whom a claim is made may assert his/her answer and any claims he/she has against the party claiming against him/her and both claims shall be resolved at trial. B. Cross Claim. A party against whom a claim is made may assert any claim he/she has against a co-party and have such claim resolved at trial. C. Third Party Claim. A party against whom a claim is made may complain against a third party who is or may be liable for payment or performance of the claim of the opposing party and have such complaint resolved at trial. RULE 9 AMENDMENT OF PLEADINGS A. Amendment before Trial. A party may amend his/her pleadings once before the opposing party has replied or if no reply is required, not less than twenty (20) days before the case is scheduled for trial. The opposing party may respond, if appropriate, and the trial date is delayed if necessary. Other amendments shall be allowed only upon motion and Order of the Court. B. At Trial. When issues or evidence not raised in the pleadings are heard at trial, the judgment may conform to such issues or evidence without the necessity of amending the pleadings. RULE 10 PARTIES A. Real Party in Interest. Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except a personal representative or other person in a fiduciary position can sue in his/her own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is maintained. B. Guardian ad Litem. When an infant, insane or incompetent person who has not had a general guardian appointed, is a party, the Court may appoint a Guardian ad Litem to represent such person in the suit or action. C. Joinder of Parties To the greatest extent possible given the limited jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, all persons or parties interested in a particular action may be joined in the action, but failure to join a party over whom the Court has no jurisdiction will not require dismissal of the action unless it would be impossible to reach a just result without such party; otherwise, the failure to join a party may be taken into account to assure that justice is done. RULE 11 INTERVENTION A. A person may intervene upon a timely application and be permitted to intervene in an action and be treated in all respects as a party to an action in cases in which the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Code or Statute confers an unconditional right to intervene; or B. When the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties. RULE 12 SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES If a party dies, becomes incompetent, transfers his/her interest or separates from some official capacity, a substitute party may be joined or substituted as justice requires. RULE 13 DISCOVERY A. Interrogatories. A party may submit written interrogatories to any other party who shall answer them in writing, under oath, within twenty-five (25) days of receipt of such. B. Depositions. Oral deposition may be taken by a party or non-party witness only upon the stipulation of the parties or upon Order of the Court based upon the demonstrated inadequacy of other discovery methods under the circumstances. C. Production, Entry or Inspection. Oral deposition may be taken of a party to produce any documents or things in his/her custody or possession for inspection or copying or request permission to enter and inspect property reasonably related to the case, and the opposing party shall within twenty-five (25) days reply as to whether or not such will be allowed and if not, why not. D. Scope of Discovery. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the pending action, whether or not such would be admissible at trial, if such appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; except that discovery may not be had of the work product of a party's counselor or attorney. E. Protective Order. A party against whom discovery is sought may move the Court for a Protective Order to prevent undue annoyance, harassment, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense, and the Court may order that the discover cease or proceed only upon specified conditions. F. Failure to Make Discovery. If a party fails to respond or appear for discovery as provided in this Rule, the opposing party may move for an Order to compel the defaulting party to perform and the Court may award costs to the non-defaulting party. If a party fails to perform after being ordered to do so by the Court, the Court may, upon motion, order that a certain fact, claim or defense be deemed established or strike part of a claim or defense, or dismisses or renders a judgment by default against the non-complying party in an aggravated case. G. Use of Discovery. Answers to interrogatories and depositions may be used in a motion, hearing or at trial to impeach or contradict the testimony of the person discovered, or by an adverse party for any purpose, or to supply evidence otherwise unavailable to the Court. RULE 14 CUSTOMARY PRETRIAL PROCEDURES A. Intent. These pretrial procedures are intended to establish means whereby both civil and criminal disputes can be settled in the traditional, customary Indian manner, by discussion between the parties before a trusted, impartial trial authority prior to resorting to formal trial procedures adopted from the non-Indian society and incorporated as a part of Tribal Law. The procedures require that formal court authority be invoked by the filing of a complaint, but anticipate that a great percentage of cases can be settled by traditional and customary means, administered hereafter by the Tribal Court. The procedures set forth in this Rule shall not be interpreted or applied to deny any person any right otherwise guaranteed by Tribal or Federal Law. B. Applicability. The procedures established in this Rule shall apply in all cases, both civil and criminal, if, at the appropriate times referred to herein, there are two (2) or more Judges of the Tribal Court holding office and available to participate as provided herein. C. Time. Not less than two (2) weeks prior to the scheduled trial date of a civil or criminal case, or at such other time prior thereto as the Chief Judge shall order, a customary pretrial conference shall be held as provided herein. D. Civil Cases. A customary pretrial conference as provided herein shall be held in all civil cases once the case is at issue. All plaintiffs and all defendants shall be required to attend the customary pretrial conference in a civil case. The parties may, upon obtaining the advance consent of the judge assigned to conduct the customary pretrial conference, bring with them such other persons, not including their attorney, advocate or lay counselor, as will tend to further the resolution of the issues of the case. E. Criminal Cases. A customary pretrial conference, as provided herein, shall be held in all criminal cases once the case is at issue by virtue of the defendant entering a plea of not guilty to a complaint. The defendant, complaining witness, arresting officer and such other witnesses as either side may desire to summon shall be required to attend the customary pretrial conference in a criminal case. Upon obtaining the advance consent of the Judge assigned to conduct the customary pretrial conference, either side may summon other persons, not including the prosecuting or defense attorneys, advocates or lay counselors, as will tend to further the resolution of the issues of the case and the proper disposition of the defendant should guilt be admitted. Such other persons may, but need not include the defendant's spouse or other family members, and any social workers, probation officers or similar persons having professional training. F. Failure to Appear: Penalties. Any person summoned to appear at a customary pretrial conference who shall fail to appear shall be subject to being charged for failing to obey the lawful order of the court and/or, if a party to the action, having the case summarily determined against him/her. G. Conduct of Customary Pretrial Conference. There shall be no record or transcript made of the proceedings at the customary pretrial conference nor shall any statement made therein by any person be used for any purpose should the case ultimately come to trial. If agreement is reached on some or all of the issues presented in the case, such agreement shall be recorded by the Judge conducting the customary pretrial conference, or Court Clerk at his/her direction, and may be embodied in a final or interlocutory order or judgment or in a pretrial order prepared to govern the conduct of any trial subsequently held. H. Attorneys and Public. Customary pretrial conferences as provided herein shall not be open to the public nor shall professional attorneys, advocates or lay counselors be allowed to attend as representatives of the parties. I. Judge's Function. The Judge conducting the customary pretrial conference shall listen to the positions of the parties and attempt to work out a settlement of all or some of the issues of the case. Such settlement shall not be inconsistent with the laws, ordinances, customs and traditions of the Tribe. J. Disposition of Cases. In the event a settlement of the case is worked out, the Judge conducting the customary pretrial conference shall cause a record to be made of such settlement by means of an order or judgment entered in the record of the case. In the event that some of the issues are not agreed to, the Judge shall cause a customary pretrial order to be prepared stating what issues have been settled and what issues remain to be tried and such customary pretrial order shall supersede the pleadings, for purposes of framing the issues for trial. The pretrial order may also contain agreements, stipulations, or orders by the Court as to the production of witnesses and evidence and the conduct of discovery before trial. If trial appears necessary, the Court Clerk shall, at the time of the customary pretrial conference, obtain the names of all persons to be subpoenaed as witnesses and prepare and arrange for service of the necessary subpoenas. K. Voluntary Agreements. No settlement of any issue in a civil case shall be made at the customary pretrial conference except with the voluntary agreement, taken by the Judge conducting the customary pretrial conference, of all parties involved in the determination of the issue. No settlement of any issue in a criminal case shall be made at the customary pretrial conference except with the voluntary agreement, taken by the Judge conducting the pretrial conference, of the defendant. The defendant in a criminal case shall be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel of his/her choosing (and at his/her own expense) if he/she so desires prior to agreeing to any judgment or order settling the case or any issue thereof or agreeing to a pretrial order. L. Criminal Defendants. A defendant in a criminal case summoned to a customary pretrial conference shall be required to attend but shall not be required to testify, cooperate or otherwise participate in the pretrial conference. The Judge conducting the pretrial conference in a criminal case shall explain these matters to the defendant at the beginning of the conference and shall, if a settlement involving an admission of guilt is reached, determine the voluntariness of the agreement and determine that the defendant understands the rights he/she is giving up to the same extent as would be determined by the Court if a guilty plea has been offered originally. If a defendant in a criminal case indicated his/her unwillingness to cooperate, no further discussion or proceeding need be held. M. Unsettled Cases. All cases not settled either in whole or in part at the customary pretrial conference shall be scheduled for trial and a trial held before a Judge as if no such pretrial conference had been held, except that any pretrial order agreed to by the parties prior to the trial shall be controlling at the trial. N. Customary Pretrial Conferences in Other Situations. In the event that the Tribal Court cannot or has not implemented the procedures set forth in this Rule, any party may request a customary pretrial conference, with counsel, before the Judge scheduled to try the case. RULE 15 JURY TRIALS A. When Allowed. Trials of all civil actions shall be before the Court without a jury unless a party to the action files a request for a jury trial and pays a fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) not less than twenty-five (25) days prior to the scheduled date of trial. A Judge may, upon good cause shown, waive payment of the required fee. B. Issues Triable. Unless the requesting party specifies otherwise, all factual issues properly triable by a jury shall be decided by the jury at trial. A party requesting a jury trial may specify only those issues he/she wants tried by the jury, and any other party may specify, not less than ten (10) days before the date scheduled for trial, any other issues he/she wishes to be so tried. Once any or all issues of a case have been requested for a jury trial, such request may not be withdrawn without the consent of all the parties. C. Designation by Judge. (1) A Judge may, upon his/her own motion, order the trial by a jury of any or all of the factual issues of a case regardless of whether or not the parties have requested such. (2) A Judge may, upon motion of any party or his/her own initiative, find that some or all of the issues designated for a jury trial are not properly triable by a jury, and order that no jury trial be held on such issues. (3) A Judge may hear and decide an issue without a jury if either party to an issue fails to appear at trial, regardless of any request made for a jury trial on such issues. RULE 16 ASSIGNING CASES FOR TRIAL A. Assignment of Judge and Date. The Court Clerk shall assign trial dates; under the supervision of the Chief Judge who shall be in direct charge of the trial calendar, with or without the request of any party, provided all parties are given adequate notice of trial dates. B. Postponement. Upon motion of a party, the Court may in its discretion, and upon such terms as it deems just, including the payment of any cost occasioned by such a postponement, postpone a trial or proceeding upon good cause shown. RULE 17 DISMISSAL OF ACTIONS A. Voluntary Dismissal. Prior to the responsive pleading of a party against whom a claim has been made or motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on such claim, the party making the claim may file a notice of dismissal, and his/her claim shall be deemed dismissed without prejudice. In all other circumstances a party may move the Court to dismiss his/her own claim, and the Court shall do so either with or without prejudice as is just and proper given the stage of the proceedings, provided, however, if a cross claim or counterclaim has been filed against the moving party, the Judge shall dismiss the claim only with the consent of the adverse party or only if it appears that the other party can prosecute his/her claim independently without undue additional hardship. B. Involuntary Dismissal. A party against whom a claim has been made may move the Court to dismiss the claim of the adverse party upon any of the following grounds: (1) Failure of the adverse party to pursue prosecution of his/her claim; or (2) Failure of the adverse party to comply substantially with these Rules; or (3) Failure of the adverse party to comply with an Order of the Court; or (4) At the close of the presentation of the other party's evidence and without prejudicing his/her own right to present evidence, failure of the opposing party to establish a right to relief based on the facts and law presented; (5) Whenever dismissal appears proper based upon a failure to prove a claim. Such dismissal shall be deemed an adjudication of the merits of the issue dismissed unless the Court shall, for good cause shown, order otherwise. The Court may postpone ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to establish a right to any relief until the close of all the evidence. (6) The Court may order a party moving to dismiss his/her own claim to pay the costs of the adverse party if the proceeding has progressed beyond the pleading stage, and may order payment of costs in other circumstances where such is deemed appropriate. RULE 18 CONSOLIDATION; SEPARATE TRIALS A. Consolidation. The Court, upon motion of any party or its own motion, may order some or all of the issues of separate actions tried together when there is a common issue of fact or law relating the actions or if such will tend to avoid unnecessary cost or delay. B. Separate Trials. The Court, to avoid prejudice or in furtherance of convenience, may order a separate trial of a claim or issue. RULE 19 EVIDENCE A. Form and Admissibility. At all hearings and trials, the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally under oath, unless otherwise provided in these Rules. All evidence admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, or as specified in this Tribal Code, shall be admissible and the competency of witnesses to testify shall be similarly determined. B. Examination and Cross Examination. (1) A party may not use leading questions against an adverse party or hostile witness. (2) A party may call any person to be a witness and examine any witness so called on any matter relevant to the action. A party may impeach their own witness. (3) Cross examination shall be limited to the general scope of direct examination, provided, however, that full examination of all witnesses shall be allowed on direct or cross examination to assure complete development of all relevant facts. C. Physical Evidence. Written documents and other physical evidence shall be received upon being identified, authenticated, and showing of relevance to the action. D. Official Documents. Official documents or an official law, record or copy thereof, may be admitted into evidence upon the testimony of an official having custody or official knowledge thereof or without such testimony if the document or record or copy thereof is accompanied by a certificate identifying as such and stating that it is a true and correct representation of what it purports to be. E. Record of Excluded Evidence. In an action tried by a jury, excluded evidence may, upon request, be included in the record for purposes of appeal and excluded oral testimony shall be put into evidence by means of an offer of proof made out of the hearing of the jury. In an action tried only by the Court, the Judge may receive such excluded testimony into the record. RULE 20 SUBPOENAS A. Issuance. Subpoenas for attendance of witnesses or production of documents or things shall be issued and served as provided in Section 1-7-1 in this Tribal Code. B. Failure to Appear. A person who has been properly served with a subpoena and fails to appear or produce may be deemed in contempt of Court and/or the Court may order his/her arrest for the offense of Failure to Obey a Lawful Order of the Court. C. Subpoena Unnecessary. A person in Court, or before a judicial officer, may be required to testify in the same manner as if he/she were in attendance upon a subpoena. RULE 21 JURORS A. Number of Jurors: Alternates. There shall be six (6) jurors chosen to hear a case, plus the Court may allow one additional juror to be chosen as an alternate juror. In the event that an alternate juror is chosen and hears the case, he/she shall be dismissed prior to the jury's deliberation if not needed, and treated like a regular juror if needed. B. Examination of Jurors. The Court may permit the parties or their attorneys to conduct the examination of prospective jurors or may itself conduct the examination. C. Challenges. (1) A challenge is an objection made to a potential trial juror. Either party may challenge jurors but where there are several parties on either side, they must join in a challenge before it can be made. (2) Challenges to jurors are either peremptory or for cause. Each party or side shall be entitled to three (3) peremptory challenges. (3) Challenges for cause shall be made against a potential juror on the grounds that he/she is not entitled or qualified to be a juror, he/she is familiar with the case or has formed an opinion regarding the case, or if for any other reason it appears likely or reasonably possible that a juror will not be able to render a fair, impartial verdict. The Judge may take evidence relative to a challenge for cause and shall in any event render a decision thereon. D. Selection of Jury. The Court Clerk shall draw lots to determine potential jurors and shall replace jurors for whom a challenge is sustained until a full panel is completed. Upon completion, the Court Clerk shall administer the oath to the jurors, the form of which shall be prescribed by Rule of the Court. E. Discharge of Juror. If, after the proceedings begin and before a verdict is reached, a juror becomes unable or disqualified to perform his/her duty, the alternate juror shall take their place; if there is no alternate juror, the parties may agree to complete the action with the other jurors. If no agreement can be reached, the Judge shall discharge the jury and the case shall be tried with a new jury. F. View of Jury. The Court, for good cause shown, may allow the jury to view the property or place of occurrence of disputed or otherwise relevant event. G. Separation of the Jury. Any time prior to their verdict when the jurors are allowed to leave the courtroom, the Judge shall admonish them not to converse with or listen to any other person on the subject of the trial and further admonish them not to form or express an opinion on the case until the case is submitted to the jury for their decision. H. Deliberation. Once the case is submitted to them, the jury shall retire to deliberate in private under the charge of an Officer of the Court, who will refrain from communicating with them except to inquire whether they have reached a verdict, and he/she shall prevent others from improperly communicating with the jury. I. Items Taken by Jury. The jury may take with them when deliberating any of the following: (1) The Court's instructions; (2) Papers or items received in evidence as exhibits; (3) Notes taken by the jurors themselves, but not notes taken by a non-juror. J. Additional Instructions. If after the jury retires, there is some question on an instruction or other point of law or disagreement regarding the testimony, the jury may request additional instructions from the Court, such to be given on the record after notice to the parties or their counsel. K. No Verdict. If the jury is discharged before rendering their verdict or for any reason prevented from giving a verdict, the action shall be retried. L. Declaration of the Verdict. When all or at least five (5) of the six (6) jury members agree on a verdict, they shall so inform the officer who shall notify the Court. A unanimous verdict shall be required in a criminal trial. They jury shall be conducted into the courtroom and the Court Clerk shall call the jury roll; the verdict shall be given in writing to the Court Clerk and then read by the Court Clerk for the Court; the inquiry shall be made by the Court to the jury foreman as to whether such is their verdict. Either party may have the jury polled individually to determine if such is, in fact, their verdict. If insufficient jurors agree with the verdict, the jury shall be sent out again to reconsider; otherwise, the verdict is complete and the jury shall be dismissed. If the verdict is read or recorded incorrectly by the Court Clerk or foreman, the jury shall retire to correct the verdict. RULE 22 SPECIAL VERDICTS AND INTERROGATORIES The Court may require the jury to return their verdict in the form of specific findings on specified issues or may require the jury to return a general verdict accompanied by answers to questions related to the issues under consideration. RULE 23 INSTUCTIONS TO THE JURY: ARGUMENTS A. Instructions. At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time as the Court may direct, any party may file written requested instructions for the Court to give to the jury. The Court shall inform the parties or their counsel of the instructions it intends to give and hear argument thereon out of the hearing of the jury. B. Arguments. Final arguments for the parties shall be made after the jury has been instructed. The Court shall not comment on the evidence of the case and, if it should restate any of the evidence, it shall inform the jury that they are the sole judges of the facts. RULE 24 MOTIONS FOR DIRCTED VERDICT AND FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT A. Motion for a Directed Verdict. A party who moves for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence offered by the opposing side may offer evidence as if no motion had been made in the event that the motion is denied. A motion for directed verdict shall state the grounds therefore and may be granted by the Court without the assent of the jury. B. Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict. A party who has made a motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, which motion has been denied or not granted, may, within ten (10) days after entry of judgment move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and entered according to his/her motion for directed verdict; or if there has been a verdict, the party may so move within ten (10) days after the jury has been discharged. A motion for a new trial may be made in the alternative. The Court shall enter judgment or make any orders consistent with his/her decision on the motions. RULE 25 FINDINGS BY THE COURT In cases tried without a jury, and except in cases where a party defaults, fails to appear or otherwise waives such, findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made by the Court in support of all final judgments. Upon its own motion or the motion of any party within ten (10) days of the entry of judgment, findings may be amended or added to and the judgment may be amended accordingly. RULE 26 JUDGMENT: COSTS A. Definition. A judgment includes any final order from which an appeal is available and no special form of judgment is required. B. Judgment on Multiple Claims. When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, however designated, a final judgment may be entered on less than all of such claims only upon the Court specifically finding that such is justified. Absent such a finding, an order or decision will not terminate the action as to any of the claims until all claims are finally decided, nor will the appeal period commence to run. C. Demand for Judgment. (1) Generally: Except in the case of a default judgment, every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if such relief is not demanded in the pleadings. It may be given for or against one or more of several claimants; and it may, if justice so requires, determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as between or among themselves. (2) Judgment by Default: A judgment by default shall not be different in kind from nor exceed in amount that specifically prayed for in the demand for judgment. D. Costs. Unless the Court shall otherwise direct, the Court shall allow necessary costs and disbursements to the prevailing party or parties as a matter of course. Such prevailing party shall file with the Court a verified memorandum of his/her costs and necessary disbursements with five (5) days of the entry judgment and serve a copy of such on the opposing party, and if such are not objected to within ten (10) days, they shall be deemed to be a part of and included in the judgment rendered. SWITCA may award costs in a like manner. E. Attorney's Fees. The Court shall not award attorney's fees in a case unless such have been specifically provided for by a contact or agreement of the parties under dispute, or unless it reasonably appears that the case has been prosecuted for purposes of harassment only, or that there was no reasonable expectation of success on the part of the affirmatively claiming party. In any action in which the Tribe and/or any of its officers or employees are sued for a cause of action arising out of, or in the course of, the performance of a Tribal function or duty, or in any action, except by the Tribe, against the bond of any such officer or employee, if judgment shall be against the plaintiff the Court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee against such plaintiff and in favor of the defendant(s). RULE 27 DEFAULT A. Entry of Default. When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these Rules, his/her default may be entered by the Court and judgment by default granted. Once the default is entered no further notice to the defaulting party of any action taken or to be taken need be given. B. Judgment by Default. Judgment by default may be entered by the Court if a party's claim against the opposing party is for a sum of money, which is or can be made certain by computation, and if the opposing party has been personally served on the Pueblo of Picuris or within its exterior boundaries. Otherwise, judgment by default can be entered only by the Court upon receipt of whatever evidence the Court deems necessary to establish the claim. No judgment by default shall be entered against the Pueblo of Picuris. C. Setting Aside Default. The Court may, for good cause shown, set aside either an entry of default or a default judgment. RULE 28 SUMMARY JUDGMENT Any time twenty (20) days after commencement of an action, any party may move the Court for summary judgment as to any or all of the issues presented in the case and such shall be granted by the Court if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Such motions, which shall be served not less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing on said motion, may be supported by affidavits, discovery, or memoranda, all of which must be made available to opposing parties at least two (2) days prior to the hearing. RULE 29 ENTRY OF JUDGMENT A. Judgment. Judgment upon verdict of a jury shall be signed by the Court Clerk and filed. All other judgments shall be signed by the Judge and filed with the Court Clerk. B. Effectiveness: Recordation. A judgment is complete and shall be deemed entered for all purposes when it is signed and filed as provided herein. The Court Clerk shall immediately make a notation of the judgment in the register of actions. C. Death of a Party. If a party dies after a verdict or decision upon any issue of fact and before judgment, judgment may nevertheless be entered thereon. D. Satisfaction of Judgment. A judgment may be satisfied, in whole or in part, as to any or all of the judgment debtors by the owner thereof or his/her attorney of record executing under oath and filing an acknowledgment of satisfaction specifying the amount paid and whether such is a full or partial satisfaction. A Judge may order the entry of satisfaction upon proof of payment and failure of the judgment creditor to file a satisfaction. The Court Clerk shall file all satisfactions of judgment and note the amount thereof in the register of actions and dockets. E. Effect of Satisfaction: Limitation. A judgment satisfied in whole, with such fact being entered in the judgment docket, shall cease to operate as such. A partially satisfied judgment or unsatisfied judgment shall continue in effect for eight (8) years or until satisfied. An action to renew the judgment remaining unsatisfied may be maintained any time prior to the expiration of eight (8) years and will extend the period of limitation an additional eight (8) years and may be thereafter further extended by the same procedure. RULE 30 NEW TRIALS: AMENDMENTS OF JUDGMENT A. Grounds; Time. Any party may petition for a new trial on any or all of the issues presented by serving a motion not later than ten (10) days after the entry of judgment, for any of the following causes: (1) Error or irregularity which prevented any party from receiving a fair trial; or (2) Misconduct of the jury or jury members; or (3) Accident or surprise, or newly discovered evidence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against or produced at trial; or (4) Damages so excessive or inadequate that they appear to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice; or (5) Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or that it is contrary to the law; or (6) Error in law. B. Harmless Error. A new trial shall not be granted on the basis of error or irregularity which was harmless in that it did not affect substantial justice. C. Support for Motion. Parties may include memoranda or affidavits in support of their motions to which reply memoranda and affidavits shall be allowed if desired. D. Court Initiative. The Court may, on its own initiative, but not later than ten (10) days after entry of judgment, order a new trial on any grounds asserted by a party to the action, and shall specify the reasons for so ordering. E. Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment. A motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be served not later than ten (10) days after entry of the judgment. RULE 31 RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER A. Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors arising from oversight or omission time may be corrected by the Court at any time on its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice as the Court may direct; mistakes may be corrected before an appeal is docketed with SWITCA, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be corrected with leave of SWITCA. B. Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud; etc. (1) On motion and upon such terms as are just, the Court may in the furtherance of justice, relieve a party or their legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: a. Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; b. Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under RULE 30 (A); c. Fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party; d. When, for any cause, the summons in an action has not been personally served upon the defendant and the defendant has failed to appear in said action; e. The judgment is void; f. The judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or g. Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time and for reasons (a), (b), (c), or (d), not more than three (3) months after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under this subdivision does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. This Rule does not limit the power of a Court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order or proceeding or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the Court. The procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these Rules or by an independent action. RULE 32 HARMLESS ERROR No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence, and no error or defect in any ruling or order in anything done or omitted by the Court or by any of the parties, is ground for granting a new trial or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the Court inconsistent with substantial justice. The Court at every stage of the proceeding shall disregard any error or defect in the proceeding, which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. RULE 33 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT A. Stay Upon Entry of Judgment. Proceedings to enforce a judgment may issue immediately upon the entry of the judgment, unless the Court in its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, otherwise directs. B. Stay on Motion for New Trial or for Judgment In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the Court may stay the execution of, or any proceedings to enforce, a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment or of a motion for relief from a judgment or order, or a motion for judgment in accordance with a motion for a directed verdict, or of a motion for amendment to the findings or for additional findings. C. Injunction Pending Appeal. When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the Court in its discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such conditions as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party. D. Stay Upon Appeal. When an appeal is taken, the appellant, by giving a bond in an amount set by the Court, may obtain a stay, unless such a stay is otherwise prohibited by law or these Rules. The bond may be given within ten (10) days after the time of filing the notice of appeal. The stay is effective when the bond is approved and received by the Court. E. Stay in Favor of the Tribe or Agency Thereof. When the Tribe, or an officer or agency of the Tribe takes an appeal, and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant. F. Power of Appellate Court Not Limited. The provisions in this Rule do not limit any power of SWITCA or of a Judge or Justice thereof to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered. G. Stay of Judgment Upon Multiple Claims. When a Court has ordered a final judgment on some, but not all, of the claims presented in the action under the conditions stated in Rule 25, the Court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered. H. Waiver of Undertaking. In all cases, the parties may, by written stipulation, waive the requirements of this Rule with respect to the filing of a bond or undertaking. In all cases where an undertaking is required by these Rules, a deposit with the Court in the amount of such undertaking, or such lesser amount as the Court may order, is equivalent to the filing of the undertaking. RULE 34 DISABILITY OF A JUDGE If by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a Judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the Court under these Rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then any other Judge assigned to the Court may perform those duties; but if such other Judge is satisfied that he/she cannot perform those duties because he/she did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he/she may in his/her discretion grant a new trial. RULE 35 INJUNCTIONS A. Preliminary Injunction; Notice. No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party. B. Temporary Restraining Order: Notice; Rehearing; Duration. No temporary restraining order shall be granted without notice to the adverse party unless it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before notice can served and a hearing held thereon. Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of issuance; and shall be filed forthwith in the Court Clerk's office and entered on record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its term within such time after entry, not to exceed fifteen (15) days, as the Court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period of time. The reasons for the extension shall be entered into record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set for a hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence of all matters except for older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes to a hearing, the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if he/she does not do so, the Court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On two (2) days notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining orders without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the Court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the Court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require. C. Security. Except as otherwise provided by law, no restraining or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the Court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such security shall be required of the United States, the Pueblo of Picuris, or an officer, or agency, or either; nor shall it be required of a married person in a suit against the other party of the marriage contract. A surety upon a bond or undertaking under this Rule subjects oneself to the jurisdiction of the Court and irrevocably appoints the Clerk of the Court as their agent upon whom any papers affecting their liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. Liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the Court prescribes may be served on the Clerk of the Court who shall forthwith mail copies to the persons giving the security if their addresses are known. D. Form and Scope of Injunction or Restraining Order Service. Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not be referenced to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise. E. Grounds for Injunction. An injunction may be granted: (1) When it appears by the pleadings on file that a party is entitled to the relief demanded and such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually; (2) When it appears from the pleadings or by affidavit that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce great or irreparable injury to the party seeking injunctive relief; (3) When it appears during the litigation that either party is doing or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering some act to be done in violation of the rights of another party to the litigation respecting the subject matter of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual; (4) In all other cases where an injunction would be proper in equity. RULE 36 EXTAORDINARY WRITS A. Grounds for Relief. Where no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy exists, relief may be obtained by obtaining an extraordinary writ, which may be granted, for any one of the following grounds: (1) Where any person usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public office or does or permits to be done any act which by law works a forfeiture of their office; or (2) Where an inferior tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial functions has exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion. Except in cases of extraordinary injustice, habeas corpus relief shall not be available to a person incarcerated as a result of a criminal conviction where the alleged grounds for relief have been or could have been raised by an appeal following the conviction. RULE 37 EXECUTION A. Interrogatories. Immediately upon the entry of a judgment awarding money damages, costs and/or attorney's fees against a party, unless such judgment has been properly stayed, the prevailing party may serve interrogatories upon the judgment debtor to inquire as to the status of said person's financial affairs and ability to pay said judgment. Interrogatories shall be served either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, on the judgment debtor, who shall answer the same in spaces provided on the interrogatories, in writing and under oath, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the same. The original copy of the answers shall be filed with the Court, and a copy, if provided by the debtor, shall be served upon the prevailing party. The party upon whom the interrogatories are served may, in the alternative, tender to the prevailing party all amounts then due under the judgment, in which case the prevailing party shall forthwith file a satisfaction of judgment with the Court. B. Appearance of Judgment Debtor. In the event that the judgment debtor fails to respond to the interrogatories in the period specified, or the answers thereto are shown to be false, misleading, or otherwise inadequate, the Court may order that the judgment debtor appear before it to answer concerning his/her property. C. Time for Execution. Except upon good cause shown giving adequate justification therefore, no execution shall be issued until the judgment debtor has been served with interrogatories and given the opportunity to pay the judgment or respond to the interrogatories. D. Execution. A writ of execution shall be issued by the Court and shall direct the BIA/NPA Law Enforcement to seize and deliver to the Court, sufficient, unrestricted and non-exempt personal property of the debtor to pay judgment and costs of sale. The writ of execution shall specify the particular property to be seized. Immediately upon receipt of the property, the clerk shall cause it to be appraised by three (3) disinterested persons, one selected by the judgment creditor, one by the judgment debtor, and one by the Court Clerk, and all admonished by the Court to make an impartial appraisal. Within seven (7) days of appraisal, the clerk shall post in three (3) public places within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris and publish in the local paper, a notice of sale containing a description of the property and its appraised value. The Court Clerk shall sell the property publicly to the highest bidder, but not for an amount less than the appraised value. Payment for property shall be made at time of sale. The Court Clerk may postpone the auction at his/her discretion if there is inadequate response to the auction or the bidding, and may reschedule such upon giving the required notice. The Court Clerk shall give a certificate of sale to the purchaser at time of payment. The Court Clerk shall pay into the Court the expenses of the sale and any unpaid court costs of the debtor from the proceeds of the sale, and shall pay the balance up to the full amount of the judgment less unpaid costs to the plaintiff. Any excess shall be paid to the judgment debtor. E. Exemption from Execution. The Court shall only order seizure and sale of such property of the judgment debtor to satisfy a money judgment the loss of which will not impose an immediate substantial hardship on the immediate family of the judgment debtor. Only property of the judgment debtor may be subject to execution and not property of his/her family. F. Redemption from Sale. At any time within six (6) months after sale under this Rule, the judgment debtor may redeem his/her property from the purchaser thereof by paying the amount such purchaser paid for the property plus eight (8) percent interest, plus any expenses actually incurred by the purchaser, such as taxes and insurance to maintain the property. RULE 38 APPEAL A. Appellate Court. All appeals from the Tribal Court shall be heard and decided by the Southwest Intertribal Court of Appeals (SWITCA). B. Right to Appeal. Any party who is aggrieved by any final order, commitment, or judgment of the Tribal Court may appeal in the manner prescribed by this Rule. C. Time: Notice of Appeal. A written Notice of Appeal must be filed with the Tribal Court within twenty (20) days from the entry of the Order of Judgment. The notice must specify the parties to the appeal, the Order of Judgment appealed from, and a short statement of the reason or grounds for the appeal. The Court Clerk shall file the notice and mail copies, to be provided by the appealing party, to all other parties to the appeal at their last known address. D. Parties. The party taking the appeal shall be referred to as the appellant; all other parties shall be referred to as the respondents. The name of the case shall be the same as that used in the Tribal Court. E. Bond on Appeal. At the time of filing the Notice of Appeal, the appellant shall also file a cash or surety bond in an amount set by the Tribal Court sufficient to guarantee performance of the judgment if such performance is stayed on appeal plus, in any event, sufficient to guarantee payment of such costs or interest as the Appellate Court may award. F. Stay Pending Appeal. In any case in which an appeal is perfected as required by this Rule, the appellant may petition the Tribal Court for an order staying the order, commitment or judgment rendered conditioned upon execution of a bond to guarantee performance of the judgment, order or commitment. A stay shall be granted in all cases in which it is requested unless manifest injustice would result therefrom. G. Clerk. Within five (5) days after a Notice of Appeal is filed, the Court Clerk shall transmit a copy of the notice and any docket entries, including the date and names of persons receiving notice of the appeal, to the SWITCA Clerk after noting on each copy the date and time the notice of appeal was filed, and shall serve it as required by Tribal Law within twenty-four (24) hours after receiving the notice, unless the Tribal Court extends the time by order. H. Briefs and Memoranda. (1) Unless the SWITCA panel orders otherwise, within thirty (30) days after being served notice indicating that SWITCA has accepted the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Tribal Court Clerk a written brief or statement in support of the appeal. (2) Unless the SWITCA panel orders otherwise, the appellee shall file an answer brief within thirty (30) days of service of appellant's brief and file written certification of such service with the Tribal Court. No additional fee for the filing of the appellee's brief shall be charged. (3) Unless the SWITCA panel orders otherwise, the appellant may file a reply brief within fifteen (15) days after being served a copy of the answer brief and file written certification of service on the other parties with the Tribal Court. No other briefs shall be filed. (4) The party submitting a brief shall file with the Tribal Court certification of service of the brief upon counsel or, in the absence of counsel, upon the parties to the appeal. Service may be made personally or by certified mail. In the case of a pro se party, the Tribal Court may serve copies on the other party according to Tribal Law. (5) The original and required number of copies of the brief shall be filed with the Tribal Court Clerk. (6) If the appellant fails to file a brief within the time provided by this Rule, or as extended, the appellee may file a motion for dismissal of the appeal with the Tribal Court Clerk who shall notify SWITCA within twenty-four (24) hours. If an appellee fails to file a brief, the appellee may not be heard at oral argument except by permission of the court. I. Argument. The Appellate Panel shall decide all cases upon the briefs, memoranda and statements filed plus the record of the Tribal Court without oral argument unless either party requests oral arguments, which must be requested in writing within thirty (30) days after Notice of Appeal is filed, and shows to the panel that such will aid the panel's decision. The panel, on its own motion, may decide to hear oral argument if it will assist the panel in making its determination. J. Decision, Content and Form of Judgment. (1) The Appellate Panel may dismiss the appeal, affirm or modify the decision being reviewed, reverse the decision in whole or in part, order a new trial, or take any other action as the merits of the case and the interest of justice may require. (2) The decision of the Appellate Panel shall be issued in writing. The Appellate Clerk shall send the original of the opinion and judgment to the Tribal Court by certified mail. The Tribal Court Clerk shall serve all parties with a copy of the opinion and judgment and file an affidavit of service with the Appellate Clerk. (3) The Appellate Clerk shall prepare and file the judgment following receipt of the opinion of the Appellate Court. Filing the judgment with the Appellate Court constitutes entry of the judgment. RULE 39 FORMS Any forms adopted for use in the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Courts are illustrative only and not mandatory unless otherwise specified. RULE 40 COURT RULES A. The Chief Judge of the Tribal Court, with the approval of the Tribal Council, may adopt Court Rules not inconsistent with these Rules and in supplement thereto. B. If no procedure is specifically prescribed by Rule, the Court may proceed in any lawful manner not inconsistent with the Rules or the principles of justice and fairness underlying these Rules. RULE 41 CITATION These Rules shall be known as the Pueblo of Picuris Rules of Civil Procedure and may be abbreviated \"P.P.R.C.P.\" TITLE 3 RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURES RULE 1 SCOPE, PURPOSE AND CONSTRUCTION A. These rules govern the procedure in all criminal proceedings in the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court and all preliminary or supplementary procedures as specified herein. B. Every proceeding in which a person is charged with an offense of any degree is a criminal proceeding. C. These rules are intended to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be construed to secure simplicity, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay. RULE 2 PROSECUTION OF OFFENSES A. No person shall be punished for an offense except upon a legal conviction, including a plea or admission of guilt in open court, by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided, however, that no incarceration or other disposition of one accused of an offense prior to trial in accordance with these rules shall be deemed a punishment. B. All criminal proceedings shall be prosecuted in the name of the Pueblo of Picuris, Plaintiff, against the person charged with an offense, referred to as the defendant. RULE 3 RIGHTS OF DEFENDANT In all criminal proceedings, the defendant shall have the following rights: A. To appear and defend in person or by counsel, except: (1) The defendant may represent him/herself or be represented by an adult enrolled Tribal member, or by any attorney admitted to practice before the Tribal Court, but no defendant shall have the right to have appointed professional counsel provided at the Tribe's expense. B. To be informed of the nature of the charges against him/her and to have a copy thereof; C. To testify on his/her own behalf, or to refuse to testify regarding the charge against him/her, provided, however, that once a defendant takes the stand to testify on any matter relevant to the immediate proceeding against him/her, he/she shall be deemed to have waived all right to refuse to testify in that criminal proceeding; D. To confront and cross-examine all witnesses against him/her, subject to the Rules of Evidence; E. To compel by subpoenas the attendance of witnesses for his/her defense; F. To have a speedy public trial by an impartial Judge or as provided in these rules; G. To appeal in all cases; H. To prevent his/her present spouse from testifying against him/her, except: (1) In any case in which the offense charged is alleged to have been committed against the spouse, or the children of either spouse or the defendant, or against the marital relationship; (2) Any testimony by the spouse on the defendant's behalf will be deemed a waiver of this privilege. I. Not to be put twice in jeopardy by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court for the same offense. RULE 4 LIMITATIONS A. Except as provided in number (2) below, a complaint shall be filed following the commission of an offense within the period specified: (1) Class A offense \u2013 3 months; (2) Class B offense \u2013 1 month; (3) Class C offense \u2013 1 week. B. The period of limitations shall commence upon the commission of the offense and shall not run during any period during which the defendant is not physically located on the Pueblo of Picuris or its exterior boundaries. RULE 5 THE COMPLAINT A. The complaint is a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. B. All complaints, other than traffic and fish and game citations, shall be made upon oath before a Judge or Court Clerk of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court. C. The complaint must state: (1) The name of the person accused, if known, or some other name if not known, plus whatever description of the person is accused is known; (2) The general location where the offense(s) was committed; (3) The general name and code designation of the offense(s); (4) A short, concise statement of the specific acts or omissions to act complained of; (5) The person against whom or against whose property the offense(s) was committed, if known, otherwise no statement need be made; (6) The date and approximate time of commission of the offense(s), if known: (7) The name of the person filling the complaint. No minor omission from or error in the form of the complaint shall be grounds for dismissal of the case unless some significant prejudice against the defendant can be shown to result therefrom. D. It shall not be necessary to charge a specific Class (Class A, B, or C) of an offense which depends on the degree of punishment upon some factual finding (e.g., the value of the property taken in a theft offense). If a factual allegation is made which will supply the information needed to determine the degree of the offense, such allegation shall be considered as true for all preliminary matters (e.g., setting bail). If no such factual allegation is made, the offense shall be considered, for all preliminary matters, to be of the least degree possible under the facts alleged. E. The Judge issuing the complaint shall examine such complainant under oath to ascertain his/her knowledge as to the facts alleged in the complaint and determine if probable cause exists to issue such complaint. F. If it appears from the complaint and the examination of the complainant that probable cause exists to believe that an offense has been committed, the Chief Judge shall issue the complaint by affixing his/her signature thereto. G. Traffic offense citations, in a form approved by the Chief Judge of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court, may be issued and take the place of the complaint in traffic offense cases. RULE 6 ARREST WARRANT OR SUMMONS A. Upon the issuance of the complaint, a warrant for arrest or a summons shall be issued to bring the defendant named in the complaint before a Judge of the Tribal Court. B. Whenever it is provided that a warrant may be issued for the arrest of a person charged with a commission of an offense, the Judge shall issue, or cause to be issued, a summons instead of a warrant, unless he/she has reasonable ground to believe that the person will not appear upon a summons, in which case a warrant for arrest shall be issued. C. The warrant for arrest shall be signed by the Judge issuing such and shall contain the name of the defendant, social security number, date of birth and all known aliases. It shall describe the offense charged and it shall command that the defendant be arrested and brought before the Judge to enter a plea. D. When a summons shall be issued, it shall name the defendant, the offense charged, and order the defendant to appear before the Chief Judge on a specific date, time and place. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a warrant for arrest shall be issued. E. Summonses shall be served by a BIA Law Enforcement officer or any other adult person designated to perform such function by the Chief Judge of the Tribal Court or the Chief of Police. (1) Such service may be accomplished any place within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris as defined in Section 1-2-2 in the Tribal Code. (2) The date, time, and place of service or arrest shall be endorsed on the warrant's or summons's return of service, along with the name of the person serving such, which shall be returned to the Court, and a copy of which, so endorsed, shall be left with the person served. (3) An officer need not have the warrant in his/her possession at the time of arrest; but if he/she does not, he/she shall inform the defendant that a warrant has been issued, the nature of the charge, and shall provide the defendant with a copy of the arrest warrant and complaint no later than at the time of arraignment. (4) If reasonably possible, a properly endorsed copy of the summons or warrant, plus a copy of the complaint shall be given to the defendant at the time of service or arrest. F. Should a defendant refuse service of a summons or should a defendant's whereabouts be unknown after a reasonable search, an arrest warrant shall be issued. RULE 7 ARRAIGNMENT A. As soon as reasonably possible after arrest, but not more than seventy-two (72) hours thereafter, or within the period designated on the summons, the defendant shall appear or be brought before the Chief Judge and the defendant shall be informed of his/her right to counsel.

At such time, the complaint will be read to the defendant, and the defendant will be asked to enter a plea. C. The defendant will enter his/her plea or the Court will enter one for him/her, and he/she will then be advised regarding sentencing or bail as is appropriate. D.

Such defendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately and all of such defendants need not be charged on each count. RULE 10 PLEAS A. A defendant may plead guilty, not guilty or no contest. The Court shall not accept a plea of guilty without first addressing the defendant and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. If the defendant refuses to plead or if the Court refuses to accept a plea of guilty, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The Court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is factual basis for the plea. B. The defendant, with the consent of the Court and of the prosecuting authority, may plead guilty to a lesser offense than that charged, which is an included offense in the offenses charged in the complaint, or to any lesser degree of the offense charged.

(3) Such motions shall be made in writing and filed with the Court at least five (5) business days before the day set for trial. Such motions will be argued before trial on the date of trial unless the Court directs otherwise. Decision on such motions shall be made by the Judge and not by the jury. (4) If a motion is decided against a defendant, the trial shall proceed as if no motion were made. If a motion is decided in favor of a defendant, the Judge shall alter the proceedings or enter judgment as is appropriate in light of the decision. RULE 12 TRIAL TOGETHER OF CHARGES A. The Court may order two or more defendants tried together if they could have been joined in a single complaint or may order a single defendant tried on more than one complaint at a single trial. B. If it appears that a defendant or the Pueblo of Picuris is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or other defendants for trial together, the Court may order separate complaints and may order separate trials or proved such other relief as justice requires. In ruling on a motion for severance, the Court may order the Pueblo of Picuris to deliver to the Court for inspection in chambers, any statement made by a defendant who the Pueblo of Picuris intends to introduce in evidence at the trial. RULE 13 DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION; ALIBI DEFENSE A.

The defendant or his/her attorney shall reveal by written notice to the Court at least five (5) working days before trial the names of any witnesses upon whom the defense intends to rely on to provide an alibi defense for the defendant. Failure to provide such notice will prevent the use of such witnesses by the defense unless it can be shown by the defense that prior notice was impossible or that no prejudice to the prosecution has resulted, in which case the Judge may order the trial delayed or make such other orders as tend to assure a just determination of the case. RULE 14 SUBPOENA A. A subpoena is an Order of the Court issued by the Chief Judge or Court Clerk. It shall contain the name of the Court, the title of the case, and shall command each person to whom it is directed, to attend and give testimony. B.

Service shall be accomplished by handing a copy of the subpoena to the person named therein. No fees or mileage allowance need be tendered with service. C. A subpoena may be served any place within the territorial jurisdiction of the Tribal Court. D. Failure, without adequate excuse, to obey a properly served subpoena may be deemed a contempt of court and prosecution thereof may proceed upon the Order of the Court.

RULE 15 TRIAL BY JURY OR BY THE COURT A. All trials of offense shall be by the Court, without a jury, unless the defendant requests for a jury trial at the time of arraignment. Failure to request a jury trial during the arraignment proceeding shall be deemed a waiver of this right. B. Juries shall be composed of six (6) members with one (1) alternate, if such is deemed advisable by the Court. C. In a case tried without a jury, the Judge shall make a general finding of guilt or innocence and shall make specific findings, which shall be embodied in a written decision. RULE 16 TRIAL JURORS A.

The alternate juror shall be dismissed prior to the jury's retiring to deliberate if he/she has not first been called to replace an original juror who has become, for any reason, unable or disqualified to serve. RULE 17 JUDGE DISABILITY A. If by reason of death, sickness or other disability, the Judge before whom a jury trial has commenced is unable to proceed with the trial, any other Tribal Court Judge may, upon certifying that he/she has been familiarized with the record of the trial, proceed with the trial. B. If by reason of death, sickness or other disability, the Judge before whom the defendant has been tried is unable to perform the required duties of a Judge after the verdict or finding of guilt, any other Tribal Court Judge may perform those duties unless such Judge feels he/she cannot fairly perform those duties, in which case a new trial may be granted. A new trial shall not be granted if all that remains to be done is the sentencing of a defendant. RULE 18 EVIDENCE The admissibility of evidence and the competence and privileges of witnesses shall be governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence, except as herein otherwise provided. RULE 19 EXPERT WITNESSES AND INTERPRETERS A. Either party may call expert witnesses of their own selection and each bear the cost of each. B. The Court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection and each party may provide their own interpreters. An interpreter through whom testimony is received from a defendant or witness or communicated to a defendant or other witness shall be put under oath to faithfully and accurately translate and communicate as required by the Court. C. The Trial Judge or Court Clerk may act as interpreter with the consent of all parties. RULE 20 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL A. The Court on motion from defendant or on its own motion shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the complaint after the evidence of either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction of such offenses. A motion for acquittal by the defendant does not affect his/her right to present evidence. B. If a motion for judgment of acquittal is made at the close of all evidence, the Court may reserve decision on the motion, submit the case to the jury and decide the motion any time either before or after the jury returns its verdict or is discharged. RULE 21 INSTRUCTIONS At the close of the evidence or at any time during the trial as the Court directs, any party may file proposed written jury instructions. The Court shall inform counsel of its decision upon the proposed instructions prior to their arguments to the jury, but the Court shall instruct the jury after arguments are completed. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction, unless objection is made before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the instruction objected to or improperly omitted and the grounds of his/her objection. Opportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury. RULE 22 VERDICT A. The verdict of the jury shall be unanimous. It shall be returned by the jury to the Judge in open Court. B. If there are two or more defendants, the jury may at any time during its deliberations return a verdict or verdicts with respect to a defendant or defendants as to whom it has agreed; if the jury cannot agree as to all, the defendant or defendants as to whom it does not agree may be tried again. C. The defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense charged or an offense necessarily included therein if such an attempt is an offense, without the necessity of the defendant having been formally charged with such lesser offenses or with attempt. D. When a verdict is returned and before it is recorded, the jury shall be polled at the request of any party or upon the Court's own motion. If upon the poll there is not unanimous concurrence, the jury may be directed to retire for further deliberations or may be discharged. RULE 23 SENTENCE AND JUDGMENT A. A judgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict or findings, and the adjudication and sentence when imposed.

(2) After imposing sentence in a case, which has gone to trial on a plea of not guilty, the Court shall advise the defendant of his/her right to appeal. C. The determination and imposition of sentence shall be in accordance with the provision on sentencing set forth in the Pueblo of Picuris Law and Order Code. D.

RULE 24 NEW TRIAL The Court, on motion of a defendant, may grant a new trial to him/her if required in the interest of justice. If trial was by the Court without a jury, the Court, on motion of a defendant for a new trial, may vacate the judgment, if entered, take additional testimony, and direct the entry of a new judgment. A motion for a new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence may be made only within one (1) month after final judgment, but if an appeal is pending, the Court may grant the motion only on remand of the case.

RULE 25 ARREST OF JUDGMENT The Court, on motion of a defendant, shall dismiss the action if the complaint does not charge an offense or if the Court was without jurisdiction of the offense charged. The motion in arrest of judgment shall be made within seven (7) days after verdict or finding of guilty or plea of guilty, or within such further time as the Court may fix during the seven (7) day period. RULE 26 CORRECTION OR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE The Court may correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within thirty days after the sentence is imposed, or within thirty days after receipt by the Court of a mandate issued upon an affirmed judgment or dismissal of the appeal.

C. A warrant shall issue only on an affidavit(s) sworn to before the Chief Judge and establishing grounds for issuing the warrant. If the Chief Judge is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he/she shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person or place to be searched. The finding of probable cause may be based on hearsay evidence either in whole or in part. Before ruling on a request for a warrant, the Chief Judge may require the affiant to appear personally and be examined under oath.

If the motion is granted, the property shall be returned and shall not be admissible at any hearing or trial. F. No law enforcement officer shall search or seize any premises, property or person without a search warrant unless he/she knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person in possession of such property is engaged in the commission of an offense or such is done incident to a lawful arrest or under such other circumstances in which it would not be reasonable to require the obtaining of a warrant prior to the search. G. A law enforcement officer may stop any person in a public place whom he/she has probable cause to believe is in the act of committing an offense, or has committed an offense, or is attempting to commit an offense and demand of him/her their name, address, an explanation of their actions, and may, if he/she has reasonable grounds to believe his/her own safety or the safety of others nearby is endangered, conduct a frisk type search for weapons of such person.

Law enforcement officers making the arrest: (1) Must inform the person to be arrested of his/her intention to arrest him/her, of the cause or reason for the arrest and their authority to make it, except when the person to be arrested is actually engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit an offense, or is pursued immediately after its commission or an escape or if such is not reasonably possible under the circumstances; (2) Must show a warrant of arrest, if such exists, and is demanded as soon as is practicable; (3) May use reasonable force and use all necessary means to effect the arrest if the person to be arrested either flees or forcibly resists after receiving information of the officer's intent to arrest; (4) May break open a door or window of a building in which the person to be arrested is, or is reasonably believed to be, after demanding admittance and explaining the purpose for which admittance is desired; (5) May search the person arrested and take him/her and put into evidence all weapons he/she may have about their person; (6) Shall, as soon as is reasonably possible, deliver the person arrested to a detention facility. RULE 33 EXTRADITION A. If a BIA law enforcement officer arrests an individual based on a warrant issued by the State of New Mexico, the Pueblo of Picuris may hold such individual for up to forty-eight (48) hours, after any Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court sentence has been served, for transport by State officials. If State officials do not retrieve the defendant within that time, he/she shall be released. The defendant shall be entitled to bail in the amount set in the State warrant. B. If a BIA law enforcement officer arrests an individual based on a warrant from a jurisdiction other than the State of New Mexico, he/she shall be entitled to a hearing before the Tribal Court on the following issues: 1. Whether such warrant exists; 2. Whether the individual arrested is the person named in the warrant; 3. Whether the Court issuing the warrant had jurisdiction to issue the warrant; 4. Whether the arrest by BIA law enforcement was lawful. After being fully informed of his/her rights, the defendant may, in writing, waive the right to a hearing. If not waived, the hearing shall be held within two (2) days of the arrest, and the defendant shall have the right to representation of his/her choosing and at his/her own expense. Prior to the hearing the defendant shall be entitled to bail at the sum set in the warrant. C. If at the hearing the Court does not find these factors to be established by the prosecutor or other authorized person by clear and convincing proof, it shall order the defendant to be immediately released. If at the hearing the Court finds these factors to be established by the prosecutor or other authorized person by clear and convincing proof, it shall order the defendant held for a reasonable time not to exceed ten (10) days, after any Tribal Court sentence has been served, for the other jurisdiction to retrieve the defendant. After the hearing the defendant may be admitted to bail in an amount set by the Tribal Court, on the condition that he/she surrender at a specified time, and on such additional restrictions as the Court deems appropriate. If such other jurisdiction does not retrieve the defendant within that time, the defendant shall be released. RULE 34 BAIL: RELEASE FROM CUSTODY A. Except as herein provided, all persons arrested for offenses under this Tribal Code and incarcerated shall be given the opportunity to make bail and be released pending their trial or appeal. B. A bail schedule for offenses shall be adopted by rule by the Tribal Court and a defendant may obtain release from jail at any time prior to arraignment by posting the amount(s) of bail specified in the bail schedule for the offense(s) charged; provided, however, that if the arresting officer shall certify to the jailer, or if the jailer shall certify on their own observation, that the defendant is at the time he/she is brought to the jail unconscious or in an intoxicated or apparently intoxicated condition, or for any reason does not appear to be in a conscious and sober condition, such defendant shall not be allowed to post bail according to the bail schedule for eight (8) hours. The defendant shall be informed by the jailer of their right to make bail at the appropriate time that such is available. C. At the arraignment or other appropriate time, the Judge shall set bail at an amount, not to exceed twice the maximum fine payable for the offense charged, which will tend to assure the appearance of the defendant at trial or at such time as their appearance is necessary. A defendant may, at arraignment, request that any bail posted under the bail schedule be reduced or that he/she be released on their own recognizance pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (D) below. D. The Judge in his/her discretion release the defendant on their own recognizance, if it appears substantially certain, considering all relevant factors that the defendant will appear at the appointed time. E. The required bail shall be tendered in the form of a money order or certified check payable to: Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court, P.O. Box 127, Pe\u00f1asco, NM 87553, or bail bond executed by two (2) or more reliable persons as sureties subject to the jurisdiction of the Court in the form which the Court, by rule, shall direct. F. In the event the defendant fails to appear as required, the Court will forfeit any bond posted by the defendant or order the sureties of the bail bond to pay the designated amount to the Court. The liability of the sureties may be enforced by order of the Court without the necessity of an independent action or judgment. G. The Court may order the forfeiture of bail for non-appearance set aside if it appears that justice does not require the enforcement of the forfeiture. H. The Court may deny release on bail pending trial or appeal when it appears reasonably certain that the defendant will pose a serious threat to the Pueblo of Picuris and its residents, or will fail to appear if released. I. The right to be released on bail as provided herein shall not accrue until charges under this Tribal Code have been filed. Persons incarcerated in a detention center for violation of federal or state laws shall be subject to be released on bail by the jurisdiction under whose authority the arrest was made. A person arrested for violation of federal law shall not be entitled to be released on bail until the prosecution of such charges has been declined by the U.S. Attorney, plus a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed thirty-six (36) hours after receipt of notification of such declination, in which charges for violation of this Tribal Code, if any, may be filed. RULE 35 TIME COMPUTATIONS In computing any period of time in these Rules, the day of the act or event from which the designated period begins to run shall not be included, and the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or legal holiday. If a time period prescribed is less than seven (7) days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. RULE 36 MOTIONS An application to the Court for an order shall be by motion. A motion other than one made at trial or hearing shall be in writing unless the Court permits it to be made orally.

The defendant shall be released and any bail or bail bond shall be released. Such a dismissal shall not be made during trial without the consent of the defendant. B. If there is an unreasonable and unnecessary delay in bringing a defendant to trial, the Court may, on motion by the defendant or on its own motion, dismiss the complaint. RULE 38 SERVICE AND FILING OF PAPERS A. Written motions, notices of hearings and other matters heard ex parte shall be served in the manner provided for in civil actions. B.

However, if the prosecution, for good cause shown, requests and is granted a delay, and if the defendant is incarcerated not having made bail, shall be released on their own recognizance pending the rescheduled trial. RULE 40 EXCEPTIONS UNNECESSARY Exceptions to rulings or orders of the Court are unnecessary, and it is sufficient that a party at the time a ruling or order is sought, makes known to the Court his/her objection or what action they wish the Court to take and the grounds thereof; but if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence of an objection does not thereafter prejudice him/her. RULE 41 HARMLESS ERROR AND PLAIN ERROR A. Any error, defect, irregularity or variance, which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. B. Errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be recognized and acted upon by the Court even though they were not brought to the attention of the Court by counsel.

RULE 44 RULES OF COURT A. The Chief Judge may, with the approval of the Tribal Council, promulgate rules governing criminal procedure not inconsistent with these rules and in supplement thereto, and copies of such rules shall be made available for public inspection.

The provisions of this Code shall be construed in accordance with these general principles and purposes: (1) To forbid and prevent the commission of offenses and give fair warning of conduct, which is declared to be an offense; (2) To define adequately the conduct and mental state which constitute each offense and safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation; (3) To prescribe penalties which are proportionate to the seriousness of the offense and which permit recognition of differing rehabilitative needs of individual offenders while at the same time recognizing the need of society to protect itself, when necessary, from offenders; (4) To prevent arbitrary and oppressive treatment of persons accused or convicted of offenses and to promote the correction and rehabilitation of such persons.

Section 4-1-6. Prosecution for Multiple Offenses. A. When the same conduct of a defendant may establish the commission of more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for each such offense.

Section 4-1-7. Limitation. Except as provided in Section 4-1-8 below, a defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offenses are known to the prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and are within the jurisdiction of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court. Section 4-1-8. Included Offenses A. A defendant may be convicted of an offense included in an offense charged in the complaint without having been specifically charged with such included offense. An offense is so included when: (1) It is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; or (2) It consists of an attempt or conspiracy to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included therein; or (3) It differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission. B. The Court need not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him/her of the included offense. Section 4-1-9. Double Jeopardy. A. If a defendant has been prosecuted for one or more offenses arising out of a single criminal episode or the same facts as the original prosecution, a subsequent prosecution for the same or a different offense arising out of such episode or facts is barred if: (1) The subsequent prosecution is for an offense that was or should have been tried under this Code in the former prosecution, unless such subsequent trial has been ordered as a separate trial by the Judge; and the former: a. Resulted in acquittal; or b. Resulted in conviction; or c. Was improperly terminated; or d. Was terminated by a final order of judgment for the defendant that has not been reversed, set aside or vacated and that necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact that must be established to secure conviction in the subsequent prosecution. B. There is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by the trier of facts or in a determination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant conviction. A finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater offense even though the conviction of the lesser included offense is subsequently reversed, set aside, or vacated. C. There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilty that has not been reversed, set aside, or vacated; a verdict of guilty that has been reversed, set aside or vacated and that is capable of supporting a judgment; or a plea of guilty by the Court. D. There is an improper termination of prosecution if the termination takes place before the verdict, is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal, and takes place after a jury has been impaneled and sworn in, or, if the matter was to be tried without a jury, after the first witness is sworn. However, termination of prosecution is not improper if: (1) The defendant consents to the termination; or (2) The defendant waives his/her right to object to the termination; or (3) The Court finds and states for the record that the termination is necessary because: a. It is physically impossible to proceed with the trial in conformity to the law; or b. There is a legal defect in the proceeding which would make any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law; or c. Prejudicial conduct, in or outside of the courtroom, makes it impossible to proceed with the trial without injustice to the defendant or to the prosecution; or d. The jury is unable to agree on a verdict; or e. A false statement of a juror on voir dire, when questioned during jury selection, prevents a fair trial. E. A subsequent prosecution of an offense is not barred if the former prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilt held invalid on appeal or in a subsequent proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus, coram vobis, or similar collateral attack. F. Prosecution of an offense is not barred by virtue of the fact that the defendant could be or has been charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71153 (Major Crimes Act) unless such charge has, in fact, resulted in a conviction or acquittal of the defendant by a Federal Court following trial. Section 4-1-10. Burden and Presumption of Innocence. A. A defendant in a criminal proceeding is presumed to be innocent until each element of the offence against him/her is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of such proof, the defendant shall be acquitted. (1) By \"element of the offense\" is meant: a. The conduct, attendant circumstances or results of conduct proscribed, prohibited or forbidden in the definition of the offense; plus b. The culpable mental state required; but c. Jurisdiction is not an element of the offense nor is the statute of limitations or any other matter similarly unconnected with the harm or evil, incident to conduct, sought to be prevented by the offense nor is the existence of justification or excuse as defense to the offense, and such may be established by preponderance of the evidence Section 4-1-11. Negative Defenses. The prosecution need not negate any defense either in the complaint or by proof unless the defense is in issue as a result of evidence presented at trial by either side, or unless the defense is an affirmative defense and the defendant has presented evidence of such. Section 4-1-12. Presumptions of Fact. An evidentiary presumption established by this Code has the following consequences: A. When the evidence of facts which support the presumption exist, the issue of the existence of the presumed fact must be submitted to the jury unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence, as a whole, clearly negates the presumed fact; B. In submitting the issue of the presumed fact to the jury, the Court shall charge the jury that while the presumed fact must on all evidence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the law regards the facts that give rise to the presumed fact as evidence of the presumed fact. CHAPTER 2 PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY Section 4-2-1. Acts and Omissions to Act. A person is not guilty of an offense unless his/her liability is based on conduct, which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act of which he/she is physically capable. A. The following are not voluntary acts within the meaning of this Section : (1) A reflex or convulsion; (2) A bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep; (3) Conduct during hypnosis; (4) A bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual. B. Liability for the commission of an offense may not be based on an omission unaccompanied by action unless: (1) The omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense; or (2) A duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law. C. Possession is an act, within the meaning of this Section , if the possessor knowingly procured or received the item possessed or was away of his/her control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his/her possession. Section 4-2-2. Culpability; General Requirements. A. A person is not guilty of an offense unless he/she acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law may require, with respect to each element of the offense, or unless his/her acts constitute an offense involving strict liability. B. Kinds of culpability defined are: (1) Purposely: a person acts purposely with respect to an element of an offense when: a. If the element involves the nature of his/her conduct or a result thereof, it is his/her conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and b. If the element involves the attendant circumstances, he/she is aware of the existence of such circumstances, or he/she believe or hopes that they exist; (2) Knowingly: a person acts knowingly with respect to an element of an offense when: a. If the element involves the nature of his/her conduct or the attendant circumstances, he/she is aware that his/her conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and b. If the element involves a result of his/her conduct, he/she is aware that it is practically certain that his/her conduct will cause such a result. (3) Recklessly: a person acts recklessly with respect to an element of an offense when he/she consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the element exists or will result from his/her conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the person's conduct and the circumstances known to him/her, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation. (4) Negligently: a person acts negligently with respect to an element of an offense when he/she should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the element exists or will result from his/her conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of their conduct and the circumstances known to them, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation. (5) Strict Liability: an element of an offense shall involve strict liability only when the definition of the offense or element clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose strict liability for an element of the offense by use of the phrase \"strict liability\" or other terms of similar import, and when so used no proof of a culpable mental state is required to establish the commission of the element or offense. C. When the culpability sufficient to establish an element of an offense is not specifically prescribed, such element is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly, or recklessly with respect thereto. D. When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears. E. When the law provides that negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts purposely, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element is also established if a person acts purposely or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element is also established if a person acts purposely. F. When a particular purpose is an element of an offense, the element is established although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition negates the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the offense. G. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is, or should be, aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he/she actually believes that it does not exist. H. A requirement that an offense be committed willfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements appears. I. Neither the knowledge nor recklessness nor negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining the elements of an offense is an element of such offense, unless the definition of the offense so provides. J. When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or criminally negligently, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense. Section 4-2-3. Causal Relationships Between Conduct and Result. A. Conduct is the cause of a result when: (1) It is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred; and (2) The relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by this Code or the definition of the offense. (3) When a particular mental state is specified in conjunction with an element of an offense, proof of that element is not avoided because the actual result differed from that intended or that which was probable or likely under the circumstances, either in kind or degree or because a different person or property was injured or affected than that intended or than that which was probable or likely under the circumstances. Unless such differences are sufficient without consideration of the mental state involved to constitute a defense or avoidance or unless such differences are of such a magnitude that it would be unjust to find the element involved in light of such differences. Section 4-2-4. Ignorance or Mistake. A. Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact or law is a defense only if: (1) The ignorance or mistake negates a specific mental state required to establish an element of the offense; or (2) The law provided that the actual state of mind, which existed itself, constitutes a defense. B. Although ignorance or mistake would otherwise afford a defense to the offense charged, the defense is not available if the defendant would be guilty of another offense if the situation had been as he/she supposed in which case the punishment available upon conviction shall not exceed that prescribed for the other offense. C. A belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense for the prosecution of an offense based on that conduct only when: (1) The enactment defining the offense is not known to the person and has not been published or reasonably made available prior to the conduct alleged; or (2) The person acted in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of law contained in a subsequent enactment or an interpretation rendered by a Judge in a written opinion. In either case the defendant shall have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, his/her defense under this subsection . Section 4-2-5. Liability for Conduct of Another. A. A person is guilty of an offense if it is committed by his/her own conduct or by the conduct of another person for whom he/she is legally responsible, or both. B. A person is legally responsible for the conduct of another person when: (1) Acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he/she causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; or (2) He/she is made responsible for the conduct of such other person by this Code or the definition of the offense; or (3) He/she is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense. C. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if: (1) With the purpose promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, he/she; a. Solicits such other person to commit it; or b. Aids, agrees or attempts to aid such person in planning or committing it; or c. Having legal duty to prevent the commission of the offense, fails to make proper effort to do so; or d. His/her conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his/her complicity. D. When causing a particular result is an element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct causing such result, is an accomplice in the commission of that offense if he/she acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense. E. A person is legally incapable of committing a particular offense him/herself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct of another person for whom he/she is legally responsible, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of his/her incapacity. F. Unless otherwise provided by this Code or by the law defining the offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by another person, if: (1) He/she is a victim of that offense; or (2) The offense is so defined that his/her conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; or (3) He/she terminates his/her complicity prior to the commission of the offense and a. wholly deprives it of effectiveness in the offense, or b. gives timely warning to law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense. G. An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his/her complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has immunity from prosecution or has been acquitted. Section 4-2-6. Corporations and Unincorporated Associations. A. A person is legally responsible for any conduct he/she performs or causes to be performed in the name of a corporation or unincorporated association or in its behalf to the same extent as if it were performed in his/her own name or behalf. B. Whenever a duty to act is imposed by law upon a corporation or unincorporated association, any agent of the corporation or association having primary responsibility for the discharge of the duty is legally responsible for a reckless omission to perform the required act to the same extent as if the duty were imposed by law directly upon them. C. When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of his/her legal responsibility for the conduct of a corporation or an unincorporated association, he/she is subject to the sentence authorized by law when a natural person is convicted of an offense of the class involved. Section 4-2-7. Intoxication. A. Except as provided in Subsection D of this Section , intoxication of a person is not a defense unless it negates an element of the offense. B. When recklessness establishes an element of the offense, if a person, due to self-induced intoxication, is unaware of a risk of which he/she would have been aware had he/she been sober, such unawareness is immaterial. C. Intoxication does not, in itself, constitute a mental disease as that term is used in this Code. D. Intoxication which (a) is not self-induced, or (b) is the result of intoxication excessive in degree given the amount of the intoxicant, to which result the actor does not know he/she is susceptible, is an affirmative defense, if by reason of such intoxication, the person at the time of his/her conduct lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate its wrongfulness or to conform his/her conduct to the requirements of the law. E. \"Intoxication\" means a disturbance of mental or physical capabilities and/or capacities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body. Except as otherwise provided in this Code, intoxication can be proven by its external indications and no proof of specific consumption or blood alcohol content is necessary, though such evidence is permissible to prove intoxication. Section 4-2-8. Duress. A. Except as herein otherwise provided, it is an affirmative defense that a person engaged in conduct charged to constitute an offense because he/she was coerced to do so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force against his/her person or the person of another, which a law abiding person of reasonable firmness in his/her situation would have been unable to resist. B. The defense provided in this Section is unavailable to a person who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly places him/herself in a situation in which it is probable that he/she will be subjected to duress. C. It is not a defense that a woman acted on the command of her husband, unless she acted under such coercion as would establish a defense under Subsection A of this Section . No presumption of duress arises from the mere presence of the husband at the time a woman acted. D. The defense provided in this Section is unavailable in any situation where the coerced conduct threatens to cause death or serious bodily harm to some person, other than the actor, or does in fact cause such harm. Section 4-2-9. Consent. A. The consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an offense or to the result thereof is a defense if such consent negates an element of the offense or precluded the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense. B. When conduct is charged to constitute an offense because it threatens to cause or causes bodily harm, consent to such conduct or to the infliction of such harm is a defense only if: (1) The bodily harm consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not serious; or (2) The conduct and the harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest, competitive sport or other lawful activity; or (3) The consent establishes a justification for the conduct under this Code. C. Unless otherwise provided by this Code or the law defining the offense, assent does not constitute consent if: (1) It is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute an offense; or (2) It is given by a person who by reason of youth, mental disease or defect, or intoxication is manifestly unable or known to the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or the harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense; or (3) It is given by a person whose improvident consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense; or (4) It is induced by force, duress, or deception. Section 4-2-10. Entrapment. A. A public law enforcement officer or official or a person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he/she induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting an offense by either: (1) Making knowingly false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not prohibited; or (2) Employing methods of persuasion or inducement, which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it. B. The defense afforded by this Section shall be unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment. C. Except as provided in Subsection B of this Section , a person prosecuted for an offense shall be acquitted if he/she proves by a preponderance of evidence that his/her conduct occurred in response to an entrapment. The issue of entrapment shall be tried to and decided by the Court and not by the jury. Evidence of past offenses shall be admissible only if the defendant takes the stand in his/her own defense. Section 4-2-11. Mental Disease or Defect A. In any prosecution for an offense, it shall be a defense that the defendant, at the time of the conduct upon which the prosecution is based, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his/her conduct or to conform his/her conduct to the requirements of the law. B. As used in this Section , the terms \"mental disease\" or \"defect\" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct. C. The defense afforded by this Section shall not be available unless notice of intent to rely on such defense is given at least two weeks before trial. By giving such notice, the defendant will be deemed to have consented to be examined for the prosecution by not more than two professional medical or other experts for the purpose of ascertaining the state of the defendant's mental health. D. No person who, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacks capacity to understand the proceedings against him/her or to assist in their own defense shall be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as such incapacity endures. Section 4-2-12. Justification. Conduct, which is justified, is a defense to prosecution for any offense based on the conduct. The defense of justification may be claimed: A. When a person's conduct is in defense of persons or property or as otherwise described in the next succeeding five sections (\u00a7 4-2-13 through \u00a7 4-2-17 ); or B. When a person's conduct is reasonable and in fulfillment of his/her duties as a Tribal or governmental officer or employee; or C. When a person's conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by parents, guardians, teachers or other persons in loco parentis (in place of parent); or D. When a person's conduct is reasonable discipline of persons in custody under this Code. Section 4-2-13. Force in Defense of Persons. A. A person is justified in threatening or using force against another when, and to the extent that he/she reasonably believes, that such force is necessary to defend him/herself or a third person against such other's imminent use of unlawful force; however, a person is justified in using force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury only if he/she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to him/herself or a third person. B. A person is not justified in using force under the circumstances specified in Subsection A of this Section if he/she: (1) Initially provokes the use of force against him/herself with the intent to use force against as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon the assailant; or (2) Is, attempting to commit, committing, or fleeing after the commission of an offense; or (3) Was the aggressor or was engaged in a combat by agreement, unless he/she withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to such other person his/her intent to do so and the other, notwithstanding, continues or threatens to continue the use of unlawful force, Section 4-2-14. Force in Arrest. Any person is justified in using any force, except deadly force, which he/she reasonably believes to be necessary to affect an arrest or to defend him/herself or another from bodily harm while making an arrest. Section 4-2-15. Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officer. A law enforcement officer or any person acting by his/her command in his/her aid and assistance is justified in using deadly force when: A. In effecting the arrest or preventing an escape from custody following an arrest and the officer reasonably believes that both: (1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest from being defeated by resistance or escape; and; (2) The person to be arrested is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon. B. The officer is in the performance of his/her legal duty or the execution of legal process and reasonably believes the use of force is necessary to protect themselves or others from imminent danger to life. Section 4-2-16. Force in Defense of Habitation. A person is justified in using force against another when, and to the extent, that he/she reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other's unlawful entry into or attack upon their place of habitation; however, he/she is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury only if: A. The entry is made or attempted in a violent and tumultuous manner and he/she reasonably believes that the entry is attempted or made for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any dwelling or person therein, and that the force is necessary to prevent the assault or offering of personal violence; or B. He/she reasonably believes that the entry is made or attempted for the purpose of committing a Class A offense or other offense involving threat of bodily injury therein, and that such force is necessary to prevent the commission of such offense. Section 4-2-17. Force in Defense of Property. A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, other than deadly force, against another when and to the extent that he/she reasonably believes that force is necessary to prevent or terminate criminal interference with real or personal property, when that property is: A. Lawfully in his/her possession; or B. Lawfully in the possession of his/her immediate family; or C. Belonging to a person whose property he/she has a legal duty to protect. Section 4-2-18. Justification of a Defense; Civil Remedies. A. In any prosecution based on conduct, which is justified as specified in this Code, such justification is an affirmative defense. B. The fact that conduct is justifiable as specified in this Code does not abolish or impair any civil right or remedy, which might arise from such conduct. CHAPTER 3 SENTENCES AND PUNISHMENT Section 4-3-1. Sentencing in General. A. A person adjudged guilty of an offense under this Code shall be sentenced in accordance in accordance with this chapter . B. Penal laws enacted or adopted after the effective date of this Code shall be classified for sentencing purposes in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter . Section 4-3-2. Designation of Offenses. Offenses are designated as Class A offenses, Class B offenses, and Class C offenses. Section 4-3-3. Class of Offense Not Specified. Any offense for which no penalty or sentence is specified, or which is not specifically designated as a certain class of offense, shall be treated for purposes of sentencing and punishment as a Class C offense. Section 4-3-4. General Principles. The sentence imposed in each case should call for the minimum amount of custody or confinement, which is consistent with the protection of the public, the severity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant. Section 4-3-5. Sentences and Combinations of Sentences; Civil, Penalties. A. A Court may, as provided in this chapter , sentence a person adjudged guilty of an offense to any one of the following sentences or a combination of such sentences: (1) To pay a fine; or (2) Removal from and/or disqualification of public or private office, but only if such is specifically provided for as a punishment for conviction of a specific offense; or (3) Probation and/or suspension of sentence on such terms and conditions as the Court may direct; or (4) Imprisonment or confinement, either full or part time. B. A Court shall also have the authority to order a person found guilty of an offense to pay any or all of the following amounts or to do the following acts: (1) Pay court costs not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00); or (2) Pay any civil penalty provided by law; or (3) Pay money damages, surrender property, or perform any other act for the benefit of any person or party injured personally, or in his/her property, by the person found guilty, provided such injuries are fairly attributable to the act or failure to act constituting the offense for which guilty was adjudged. C. This part shall not deprive a Court of authority to cite for contempt, cancel or suspend a license, forfeit property, or do any other act or make any other order authorized by law. Section 4-3-6. Maximum Fines and Sentences of Imprisonment. A. A person convicted of an offense may be sentences as follows: (1) Class A offense \u2013 to a term of imprisonment not to exceed twelve (12) months and to a fine not to exceed five-thousand dollars ($5,000.00); (2) Class B offense \u2013 to a term of imprisonment not to exceed six (6) months and to a fine not to exceed one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00); (3) Class C offense \u2013 to a term of imprisonment not to exceed forty-five (45) days and to a fine not to exceed five-hundred dollars ($500.00). B. The terms of imprisonment listed above apply only to full-time incarceration in a BIA contracted or managed facility and do not apply to full-time or part-time residence or confinement in a medical or rehabilitative facility as a condition of probation or parole or as otherwise ordered by the Court. C. The fines listed above may be imposed in addition to any assessment of costs or other civil penalties and in addition to any amounts ordered by the Court to be paid as restitution. Section 4-3-7. Payment of Fines and Other Monies. A. Fines shall be paid by money order or certified check only, or with the consent of the Court, may be worked off by performing approved labor for the Pueblo of Picuris, at a rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per hour, or as otherwise established by the Tribal Council. B. The Court may, upon request of a defendant or upon its own motion, allow that any fine or other required payments be paid in installments and on conditions tailored to the means of the defendant. C. The imposition of incarceration should not be imposed as an automatic alternative to payment of a fine or other money, but rather the Court should, upon default to pay a fine or other money as required, examine the reason for the default and may, if justice requires, impose an additional sentence of incarceration of no more than one day of incarceration for each one- hundred dollars ($100.00) of the required money left unpaid. D. The methods available for collecting a civil judgment shall be available to collect any unpaid money upon order of the Court following a failure to make any required payment and ascertainment of a reason thereof. E. When justice requires, the Court may revoke or remit a fine or any unpaid portion thereof or any other monies required to be paid, or may modify the terms and conditions of payment. Section 4-3-8. Decision to Impose a Fine. In determining whether to impose a fine and its amount, the Court should consider: (1) The financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of a fine will impose with due regard to his/her other obligations; (2) The ability of the defendant to pay a fine on an installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the Court; (3) The extent to which payment of a fine will interfere with the ability of the defendant to make any ordered restitution or reparation to the victim of the crime; and (4) Whether there are particular reasons which make a fine appropriate as a deterrent to the offense involved or appropriate as a corrective measure for the defendant. Section 4-3-9. Concurrent and Consecutive Sentences. A. Unless the Court shall direct otherwise in its pronouncement of sentence, all sentences shall run concurrently and not consecutively. B. The Court shall consider the gravity and circumstances of the offenses and the history, character, and rehabilitative needs of the defendant as well the need to protect the public in determining whether to impose consecutive sentences. C. The Court shall not impose consecutive sentences for offenses arising out of a single course of criminal conduct, including solicitation and criminal conspiracy, unless the criminal conduct involved the death or serious bodily injury of any victim of the crime or a serious threat of such, unless the offense was committed in a willful, malicious or aggravated manner and involved an offense against the person of the victim or victims. D. In no event shall the maximum term of imprisonment imposed exceed three (3) years from the date of sentencing. E. Whenever a sentence is imposed or sentences are imposed to run concurrently with the other or with sentences presently being served, the greater sentence shall be the term to be served with all lesser sentences merging therein, or, if equal sentences are imposed, they shall merge into one sentence, but in no event shall the imposition of one sentence cut short the time to be served on another sentence unless the Court specifically directs that such be the result. Section 4-3-10. Credit. A. Credit against a term of imprisonment imposed following an adjudication of guilty shall be given to a defendant for all time spent in custody as a result of the criminal charge for which the sentence is imposed or as a result of the conduct on which such charge is based. Such credit shall apply to time spent in custody prior to trial, during trial, pending sentencing, and pending resolution of an appeal. B. In case of re-prosecution for any reason of the same offense or an offense based on the same conduct for which a defendant has been imprisoned, credit shall be given for all time spent in custody under the prior prosecution as provided in Subsection A. above. C. Credit as provided in this Section should be considered and computed by the Court at the time of sentencing. Section 4-3-11. Reduction of Sentences. A. The Court may, upon motion of any party or on its own motion, reduce or modify a sentence within a reasonable time after its imposition as provided on the Rules of Criminal Procedure if new factors bearing on the sentence become known. Such reduction or modification shall be done in open Court. B. In the event that commitment to a special type of facility, other than a detention facility, is imposed or accepted as a condition of probation or parole, the Court may for good cause shown, terminate or reduce such commitment. C.

Title This Code is known as the Pueblo of Picuris Integrated Solid Waste Management Code. Section 11-1-2. Purpose Construction and Severability. A. Findings: The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council hereby finds as follows: (1) The increasing volume and variety of solid waste and hazardous waste being generated on the Pueblo of Picuris and the often-inadequate existing methods of managing solid waste and hazardous waste are creating conditions that threaten the public health, safety and welfare of tribal members and residents of the Pueblo of Picuris by contributing to land, air and water pollution, to the production of flies, rodents and litter, to the waste of dwindling natural resources, and to the general deterioration of the Pueblo of Picuris environment. (2) The people of the Pueblo of Picuris have a primary interest in the protection and control of the land and other natural resources affected by the improper disposal of solid waste within the Pueblo of Picuris, and the quality of such land and other natural resources must be protected to insure the health, economic, aesthetic and cultural well-being of the Pueblo of Picuris People. (3) Open dumping is particularly harmful to public health, contaminates surface and underground water resources, including drinking water from underground and surface supplies and pollutes the land, air and water of the Pueblo of Picuris. (4) Inadequate and environmentally unsound practices for the disposal or use of solid waste and hazardous waste have created greater amounts of soil, air and water pollution and other problems for public health and the environment on the Pueblo of Picuris. The traditional methods of solid waste and hazardous waste management may not meet future requirements for eliminating environmental pollution and conserving natural resources. (5) Pursuant to federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court in such cases as Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981) and reaffirmed in the Strate v. A-1 Contractors 117 S. Ct. 1404 (1997), the Pueblo of Picuris possesses the inherent sovereign authority to regulate within its exterior boundaries solid waste disposal that affects fundamental tribal interests and public health and safety, including when such activities conducted by non-members of the Tribe on privately owned land within the exterior boundaries of Pueblo of Picuris. (6) Under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a76903(13) (as part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), \"Indian Tribe\" is included within the definition of \"municipality\" for purposes of the Act. (7) Methods of solid waste management emphasizing source reduction, recovery and recycling of all solid waste are essential to the long-range preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the public, to the economic productivity of the Pueblo of Picuris, to the environmental quality of the Pueblo of Picuris and to the conservation of natural resources. (8) Disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste in or on the land without careful planning and management will present a danger to the public health and environment. (9) Methods are available to separate recoverable materials from solid waste. The recovery and conservation of such material can produce numerous benefits to the Pueblo of Picuris, including economic benefits in the way of savings realized by conserving material in order to reduce the value or quantity of materials that ultimately become solid waste. (10) It is in the best interests of the Pueblo of Picuris and the residents of the Pueblo of Picuris to establish and maintain a comprehensive integrated tribal solid waste management plan, the objectives which will be to manage and control solid waste and to prohibit the introduction of hazardous waste into the Pueblo of Picuris in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of tribal members; to preserve the environment; and to provide for the maximum reuse of the resources contained in solid waste. (11) Such protection of the Pueblo of Picuris resources is not adequately provided for under existing legislation, and such protection will be furthered by the passage of, adoption and implementation of this Code. B. Purpose: The general purposes of this Code are to: 1) finance, implement, regulate, and enforce environmental standards and criteria, orders, and permit conditions, and exercise comprehensive Tribal regulatory authority over all solid waste and hazardous waste disposal matters within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris; 2) protect fundamental Tribal cultural, ceremonial, religious, fishery, and economic stability of residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, forest, wetlands, riparian and environmentally sensitive lands within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris; 3) prevent the deterioration of the environment and increase the standard of living, quality of life, health, safety and welfare of all persons within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris; 4) provide and promote Tribal environmental protection and services within the Pueblo of Picuris and to regulate environmental activities under principles of Tribal sovereignty; and 5) prevent air, water and land from solid and hazardous waste pollution, including contamination of the Tribe's aquifers, ground waters, surface waters, drinking water supplies and other natural resources. C. Authority and Scope: Authority: This Pueblo of Picuris Solid Waste Code is hereby adopted by The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council pursuant to Section 11 of the Pueblo of Picuris Law and Order Code and authorizing the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council to undertake such actions. Scope: The provisions of this Code shall apply to all existing and proposed solid waste disposal activities which have the potential to affect cultural, ceremonial, religious, fishery, seasonal residential, public health, safety, welfare, land, air or water quality and other fundamental interests of the Tribe, including such activities conducted by non-members of the Tribe or on privately owned lands. Activities to be regulated include but are not limited to: (A) Landfills and open dumps; (B) Storage of animal waste; (C) Automobile graveyards and junkyards; (D) Landfilling of sludge or septic system waste; (E) Individual, residential, industrial, commercial or agricultural sewage treatment facilities; and (F) All other activities that involve the storage, collection, transportation or disposal of solid and/or hazardous waste within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris; (G) Any and all types of industrial or investigative derived wastes including soils, sediments, aqueous liquids, decontaminated fluids, construction and demolition wastes. D. Applicability: Because any violation of this Code or any regulation adopted thereunder will demonstrably and seriously impact the environment, including land, water and air, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Pueblo of Picuris, this Code, and any regulations adopted thereunder shall apply to: (1) all persons within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris, without exception, including but not limited to, all Tribal members, and all other persons on the Pueblo of Picuris, including any Indians who are member of other Indian tribes, all non-Indians, and any other person as defined under this Code; and (2) all places and lands located anywhere within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris including all trust and non-trust lands, and notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, fee, allotment, right-of-way, lease, or any real property interest of any kind, held by any person as defined in this Code. E. Consensual Relations Among Non-Members, The Tribe and Tribal Members: Any person who is not a member of the Tribe who uses land anywhere within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris, whether trust or non-trust land, enters into consensual relationships with the Tribe or its members, through commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other arrangements. Such person's use of land involving storage, collection, transportation and disposal of solid or hazardous waste on the Pueblo of Picuris will have a demonstrably serious impact upon the environment, natural resources, public health, safety, welfare, political integrity and economic security of the Tribe and its members, unless such use is in compliance with the provisions of this Code, and any regulations promulgated hereunder.

Section 11-1-13. Solid Waste Facility Sites (A) Site Considerations. 1) Floodplains. If a solid waste disposal site or landfill is located within a 100 year floodplain, the owner or operator must demonstrate that the MSWLF will not restrict the flow of a 100 year flood, reduce temporary storage capacity of the floodplain or result in any washout of solid waste which would pose a hazard to human health or the environment. 2) Wetlands. \"Wetlands\" means those areas which are defined in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7232.2(r) and include, but are not limited to, swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas, and are defined as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency ad duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. No MSWLF shall be located in wetlands, unless the owner/operator can make the demonstrations as required under the Federal criteria set forth in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7258.12. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may, in its discretion, however, refuse to permit an MSWLF in any areas which are wetlands as defined herein. 3) Fault Areas. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located within 200 feet (60 meters) of a fault that has had displacement in Holocene time. For purposes of this section : a) \"Fault\" means any fracture or a zone of fractures in any material along which strata on one side have been displaced with respect to that on the other side. b) \"Displacement\" means the relative movement of two sides of a fault measured in any direction. c) \"Holocene\" means the most recent epoch of the Quaternary period extending from the end of the Pleistocene Epoch to the present. 4) Seismic Impact Zone. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located in a seismic impact zone unless the owner/operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department, and the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department finds, that all containment structures including liners, leachate collection systems and surface water control systems, are designed to resist the maximum peak ground acceleration associated with the maximum credible earthquake. For purposes of this Section , \"seismic impact zones\" are defined as areas having a 10 percent or greater probability that the maximum expected horizontal acceleration in lithifield earth material, expressed as a percentage of the earth's gravitational pull (g), will exceed 0.10 g in 250 years. 5) Unstable Areas. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located in an unstable area. \"Unstable area\" means a location that is susceptible to natural or human-induced events or forces capable of impairing the integrity of some or all of the landfill structural components responsible for preventing releases from a landfill. Unstable areas can include poor foundation conditions, areas susceptible to mass movements, and Karst terrains. 6) Bodies of Water. No solid waste disposal site or landfill shall be located within 1,000 feet of a lake, pond, slough, river, stream, or other body of water. To the greatest extent possible, MSWLFs will be located substantially greater distances from any surface water of significance. 7) Adverse Impact. No MSWLF shall be located in a manner that will cause significant adverse impact to recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat or populations or Pueblo of Picuris aesthetics. 8) Dwellings. To the greatest extent possible, taking into account the requirements of this Ordinance, no MSWLF shall be located within 3,000 feet of a dwelling inhabited at the time the site is created. 9) Domestic Water Well. No solid waste disposal site or landfill shall be located within 2,000 feet of a domestic water well, unless the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines in writing that the well will not be contaminated by the site and establishes a water monitoring program for the well, or the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department provides a substitute source of equal or better convenience and quality. (B) Determination Prerequisites for Reservation of Site The following information shall be submitted to the Director for review and evaluation in order for a potential solid waste landfill site to be considered: 1) A map or aerial photograph of the proposed site that shows all land within one mile of the proposed MSWLF site. The map or aerial photograph shall be of sufficient scale to show the entire property owned or leased for the disposal site by the person proposing the landfill, all homes, industrial buildings, wells, watercourses, rock outcroppings, roads and other applicable details and shall indicate the general topography. 2) A summary of the geological formations and groundwater table to a depth of at least ten feet below the proposed excavation and at lowest elevation at the site. Such data shall be obtained by soil borings or other appropriate means. 3) Identification of source and characteristics of cover material. 4) Identification of watercourses within or adjacent to the proposed disposal site and, if no watercourse is involved, name of the watershed which will receive the drainage from the site. 5) Any other information pertinent to the proposed site. Section 11-1-14. Storage (A) Sanitary Site Conditions: The owner, agent or occupant of any dwelling, residence, premises or business establishment shall be responsible for the sanitary condition of said residence, premises or business establishment. No person shall place or deposit refuse or allow refuse to be placed or deposited on any public street, road or alley within the Pueblo of Picuris.

Appropriate covers include tarps, cargo netting or closed-lid receptacles. (D) Ashes: Ashes, warm or cold, shall not be placed in plastic containers. (E) Hazardous Waste: No owner, occupant, business establishment or agency shall store hazardous waste within the boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris. The Pueblo of Picuris Integrated Solid Waste Program shall collect small quantities of household hazardous waste which shall then be transferred to a disposal service operating an EPA-approved site which accepts hazardous material. Section 11-1-15. Collection Pueblo of Picuris tribal members, residents and tribal business establishments shall be solely responsible for their own collection and disposal of solid waste at designated MSWLFs within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris or an approved collection site such as a transfer station. Section 11-1-16. Disposal (A) Applicability of Standards: This Ordinance shall apply to all MSWLFs and to all equipment used at disposal facilities on the Pueblo of Picuris. In addition, 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7258.20 through 258.29 are incorporated by reference herein. All owner/operators of MSWLFs shall comply with Part 258 Criteria, in addition to any additional waste management operating criteria specified in this Ordinance, rules or regulations, or in any conditions in the MSWLF facility operation permit, or in guidance documents, or in orders of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department. (B) Prohibition on Hazardous Waste: The receipt, acceptance, handling, storage, processing or disposal of hazardous waste at any MSWLF for disposal on the Pueblo of Picuris is prohibited, provided that the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may establish a program for collection, transfer, storage, transportation and disposal of the Pueblo of Picuris of hazardous waste generated or found on the Pueblo of Picuris. If an operator knows or has reason to believe hazardous waste has been received at a solid waste disposal facility, the operator shall notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department within two (2) hours of discovery of such waste.

Part 112, SPCC Rule; (Spill Prevention, Containment and Counter Measures Rule) and; (6) Procedures for notifying the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if hazardous waste is discovered at the facility. (C) Design: The uniform design criteria for MSWLFs contained in 40 CFR \u00a7258.40 are incorporated by reference for new MSWLFs. If the EPA has not approved the Tribe's solid waste program, then no new MSWLF units or lateral expansions shall be constructed unless they comply with Part 258 uniform design criteria, which includes a composite liner and a leachate system as set forth in 40 CFR \u00a7258.40(a)(2). If the EPA has approved the Tribe's solid waste program, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may approve the design criteria for an MSWLF, on a site-specific basis, in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7258.40(a)(1). If the Tribe does not have and EPA approved solid waste program, then the uniform design criteria in 40 CFR \u00a7258.40(a)(2) shall apply as follows, unless the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines that the small landfill exemption under 40 CFR \u00a7258.1(f)(1) applies, and that an MSWLF unit is exempt from the design criteria under Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 258. (1) There must be a composite liner, as defined in paragraph (2) below, and a leachate collection system that is designed and constructed to maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachate over the liner. (2) \"Composite liner\" means a system consisting of two components; the upper component must consist of a minimum 30 mil flexible membrane liner (FML), and the lower component must consist of at least a two-foot layer of compacted soil with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 x 10' cm/sec. FML components consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) shall be at least 60-mil thick. The FML component must be installed in direct and uniform contact with the compacted soil component. If the EPA has approved the Tribe's solid waste program, then the design performance criteria in this section applies, and a composite liner and leachate collection system are not required, but the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may require the same in his/her discretion. If the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program, or an MSWLF unit is determined to be exempt from Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 258, then the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department in approving an alternative design for an MSWLF, must consider at least the following factors: (1) The hydrogeologic characteristics of the facility and surrounding land; and (2) The climatic factors of the area; and (3) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the leachate. In addition, any site-specific design must ensure that the concentration values for chemicals listed in Table 1 of 40 CFR Part 258, which is incorporated by reference herein, will not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer at the relevant point of compliance, as specified in 40 CFR \u00a7258.40 (d) as follows: The relevant point of compliance specified by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall be no more than 150 meters from the waste management unit boundary and shall be located on land owned by the owner of the MSWLF unit. In determining the relevant point of compliance the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall consider at least the following factors: (1) The hydrogeologic characteristics of the facility surrounding land; (2) The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the leachate; (3) The quantity, quality and direction of flow of ground water; (4) The proximity and withdrawal rate of the groundwater users; (5) The availability of alternative drinking water supplies; (6) The existing quality of the ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impacts on the ground water and whether the ground water is currently used or reasonably expected to be used for drinking water. (7) Public health, safety and welfare effects; and (8) Practicable capability of the owner/operator. The design of an MSWLF site shall also be based on the service area, anticipated nature and quantity of solid waste to be received, adjacent land uses, number and type of vehicles anticipated to enter the disposal facility site, whether the facility will be used by the general public, ground and surface water, leachate control, soils, drainage, provisions for monitoring, venting, controlling and possible use of disposal facility decomposition gases and other pertinent information.

Post Closure Care Requirement for MSWLFs (A) Following closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must conduct post- closure care. Post-closure care must be conducted for thirty (30) years, except as provided under Paragraph B of this section , and must include the following: (1) Maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of any final cover, including making repairs to the cover as necessary to correct the effects of settlement, subsidence, erosion, or other events, and preventing run-on and run-off from eroding or otherwise damaging the final cover; and (2) Maintaining and operating the leachate collection system in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR \u00a7258.40. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may allow the owner or operator to stop managing leachate if the owner or operator demonstrates that leachate no longer poses a threat to human health and the environment. (3) Monitoring the ground water in accordance with the requirements of Subpart E of 40 CFR Part 258 and maintaining the groundwater monitoring system; and (4) Maintaining and operating the gas monitoring system in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a7258.23. (B) The length of the post-closure care period may be: (1) Decreased by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program and if the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the reduced period is sufficient to protect human health and the environment; or (2) Increased by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines that the lengthened period is necessary to protect human health and the environment. (C) The owner or operator of an MSWLF unit must prepare a written post-closure plan that includes, at a minimum, the following information: (1) A description of the monitoring and maintenance activities required in 40 CFR \u00a7 258.61(a) for each MSWLF unit, and the frequency at which the activities will be performed; and (2) The name, address and telephone number of the person or office to contact about the facility during the post-closure period; and (3) A description of the planned uses of the property during the post-closure period. Post-closure use of the property shall not disturb the integrity of the final cover, liner(s), or any other components of the containment system, or the function of the monitoring systems unless necessary to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 258. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may, if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste plan, approve any other disturbance if the owner or operator demonstrates that disturbance of the final cover, liner or other component of the containment system, including any removal of waste, will not increase the potential threat to human health or the environment. (D) The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that a post-closure plan has been prepared and placed in the operating record prior to the initial receipt of waste by the facility. (E) Following completion of the post-closure care period for each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must supply the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department with a certification signed by an independent registered professional engineer which verifies that all post-closure care has been completed in accordance with the post- closure plan, and shall place such certification in the operating record.

(D) Allowable Financial Mechanisms. 40 CFR \u00a7258.74 required that an owner or operator of an MSWLF unit provide financial assurance to ensure that funds necessary to meet the costs of closure, post-closure care and corrective action for known release will be available in a timely fashion when they are needed. There are four mechanisms available to provide financial assurance, including a trust fund; a surety bond; a letter of cred; an insurance policy; or a combination of all four mechanisms. Any mechanism(s) that is/are used by an owner or operator must comply with all of the criteria in 40 CFR \u00a7258.74, which is incorporated by reference herein, and must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under state, federal and Tribal law. The financial assurance mechanism(s) must be obtained by the owner or operator before the initial receipt of waste in the case of closure and post-closure care cost estimates; and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a7258.58, and maintained as required by 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7258.71-74. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the actual financial assurance mechanism(s) and financial assurance agreements that is/are provided by the owner or operator. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may also require in its discretion, in addition to the criteria for financial assurance under 40 CFR Part 258, that an owner or operator provide financial assurance for corrective action for other than known releases as a condition for issuing an MSWLF permit. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall also require that liability and property damage insurance coverage be provided by an owner or operator for claims arising from personal injury or property damage, including any claims from releases from an MSWLF unit. If a trust fund mechanism is used, the trustee must be an entity who has the authority to act as a trustee, and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency. Trust fund payments must be made as specified in 40 CFR\u00a7258.74 criteria.

Enforcement Program/Administrative Procedures Enforcement Policy: It is the policy of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department to encourage informal, practical, result-oriented resolution of alleged violations and actions needed to prevent damage to Pueblo of Picuris resources or harm to the health, safety or welfare of the Pueblo of Picuris population. It is also the policy of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department, consistent with the principles of due process, to provide effective procedures for enforcement. Enforcement Agency: The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall be responsible for enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance. Specifically, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall conduct investigations when a complaint is received by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other tribal agency believes that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred. Enforcement Activities: Where a written and verified complaint shall be filed with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, New Mexico State Police for Taos County (per Special Law Enforcement Commissions in Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council Resolution 2014-10) and the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department and reviewed by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department alleging that, or where, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department itself shall have cause to believe that, any person is violating any solid waste regulation or permit condition, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall cause a prompt investigation to be made.

In the case of an apparent violation of this Ordinance, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to the person(s) apparently responsible for the violation, and, if the apparent violation occurred on property owned by a person other than the alleged violator, a Notice of Violation shall also be issued to the landowner. In the case of a continuing violation or a threatened violation, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department is authorized to issue a Cease and Desist Order to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring. Failure to comply with a Cease and Desist Order shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. Both a Notice of Violation and a Cease and Desist Order may be issued for a single incident. A Notice of Violation will include a Summons to appear before the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court at an enforcement hearing at a specified time and date, and shall advise the alleged violator that failure to appear may result in the imposition of civil penalties. If a Cease and Desist Order is issued without an accompanying Notice of Violation, the Order will inform the recipient that failure to comply with the Order will constitute a violation of this Ordinance which will result in the issuance of a Notice of Violation and may result in the imposition of civil penalties. Informal Conferences: The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall afford the landowner or his or her representative reasonable opportunities to discuss proposed enforcement actions at an informal conference prior to taking further enforcement action, unless the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines that there may be either imminent environmental damage to a Pueblo of Picuris resource or adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the Pueblo of Picuris population. Informal conferences may be used at any stage in the enforcement proceedings, except that the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may refuse to conduct informal conferences with respect to any matter pending before the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court. Reports Required: The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall keep written notes of the date and place of the conference, the persons in attendance, the subject matter discussed and any decisions reached with respect to further enforcement action. Enforcement Hearings: If the landowner and the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department are unable to resolve the matter via an informal conference, the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court is authorized to conduct adjudicatory hearings to determine if a violation of this Ordinance has occurred. In such a hearing the Pueblo of Picuris Solid Waste Department Manager, in cooperation with the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department Director, in cooperation with the Tribal Sheriff shall present the case to the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court to establish that the person(s) charged has (have) committed a violation of this Ordinance. Any person so charged shall be entitled, at his or her own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other representative. (A) Burden of Proof. The Director of the Pueblo of Picuris Solid Waste Department Manager shall have the burden of proving that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred and that a person charged was responsible for the violation.

(B) Enforcement Orders. Within thirty (30) days after the date of any enforcement hearing, the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court shall issue a written decision. If the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court determines that a violation has occurred and that the person(s) charged was (were) responsible for the violation, the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court shall include an Enforcement Order. Section 11-1-28. Civil Penalties and Corrective Action: An Enforcement Order shall direct any person(s) found to have committed a violation of this Ordinance to take whatever corrective action the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court deems appropriate under the circumstances. An Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in accordance with a schedule of civil penalties prescribed in the Committee's rules. Alternatively, an Enforcement Order may impose civil penalties in the event that a person found to have committed a violation of this Ordinance does not take corrective action in accordance with the Order with a prescribed time frame. If a person who has been found to have committed a violation does not take corrective action within the prescribed timeframe, an appropriate department or agency of the Tribal government may by twice the amount of the cost incurred by the Tribal department or agency taking the corrective action. (A) Emergency Orders. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, if the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court determines that noncompliance with this Ordinance is presenting an imminent and substantial threat to the public health, welfare or environment and determines, in consultation with the Tribe's attorneys, that it is not practicable to assure prompt protection of the public health, welfare or environment of an administrative or judicial action under this Part, the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare or environment. Any such Order shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. (B) Revocation Permit: Failure of any person to comply with any Enforcement Orders will result in an immediate revocation of his or her permit. In order to obtain a reinstatement of such permit, the person(s) against who the Enforcement Order was issued must first demonstrate compliance with the Order and pay all outstanding penalties and then petition the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court, in writing, for reinstatement of the permit with the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department. Section 11-1-29.

Section 11-1-30.

The Court is authorized to hear such appeal. Section 11-1-31. Other Provisions Severability: If any provision of this Ordinance, or the application thereof, is held invalid, the remainder of this Ordinance, or application of such provisions, shall not be affected. Section 11-1-32. Amendments The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council reserves the sole right to amend this Ordinance and to issue rules effecting all aspects of the Ordinance. Provisions in the Ordinance allow the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council full flexibility to enact measures which will benefit the Tribe. The inclusion of these provisions does not necessitate their implementation, but allows the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council flexibility to alter the Ordinance according to the evolving needs of the Pueblo of Picuris. Section 11-1-33. Modifications and Applicability of Part 258 Criteria This Ordinance incorporates by reference all of the criteria contained in the 40 CFR Part 258. If any part of 40 CFR Part 258 is modified, any modifications are automatically incorporated by reference and become part of this Ordinance, and supercede any of the provisions that were modified. If any of the part 258 Criteria are not actually restated in this Ordinance, they are nevertheless incorporated by reference and are applicable. If the EPA approves the Tribe's solid waste program, then the Tribe has all of the flexibility granted to it under the Part 258 Criteria, whether or not such flexibility is specifically restated in this Ordinance. Any specific provisions of this Ordinance which are more stringent than Part 258 Criteria are applicable and controlling. Section 11-1-34.

TITLE 12 MEDICAL CANNABIS CODE CHAPTER 1 \u2013 GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 12-1-1. Short Title. This Title may be cited as the Medical Cannabis Code. Section 12-1-2. Findings and Purpose. The Pueblo of Picuris finds and declares that: (a) The Pueblo of Picuris is a federally recognized Indian tribe and has sovereign powers of self- government to make and enforce their own laws, rules and regulations for medical cannabis activities within tribal lands. (b) The Pueblo of Picuris has sovereign immunity from suit. (c) The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council has decided to open specific tribal lands within its jurisdiction on to the cultivation, processing, use, possession, distribution and research of medical cannabis by enacting this Title to the Pueblo of Picuris Law and Order Code. (d) The purpose of this Medical Cannabis Code is to civilly regulate those persons, licensed businesses, and lands within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris with respect to medical cannabis. (e) The Medical Cannabis Code allows for the beneficial use of medical cannabis, upon written recommendation of a medical provider, in a civilly regulated system for the purpose of alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions. (f) In 1997, New Mexico passed the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act to enable persons residing in New Mexico to obtain and use medical cannabis legally under limited, specified circumstances. The Pueblo of Picuris will cooperate with the State of New Mexico on matters of mutual concern, including law enforcement and public safety. (g) This Medical Cannabis Code regulates the lawful cultivation, processing, use, possession, distribution and research of medical cannabis in a manner consistent with federal law enforcement guidelines and priorities, and is not preempted by, nor does it violate any federal law. (h) On October 28, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice issued it Policy Statement on Cannabis Issues in Indian Country (Wilkinson Memo) which recognized the trend of states toward legalization of medical cannabis, and acknowledged that in exercising its national sovereignty Indian tribes may enact similar laws, consistent with the policy priorities therein. This Title is in compliance with the Wilkinson Memo. (i) The recorded use of cannabis goes back five thousand years. Modern medical research has confirmed the therapeutic value of cannabis in treating a wide array of debilitating medical conditions. Cannabis has many accepted medical uses in the United States, and around the world, having been recognized by public health organizations, including the Epilepsy Foundation, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the National Institute of Health, and the National Institute of Drug Abuse. (j) The Pueblo of Picuris joins the tribes, states and other jurisdictions in the passage of medical cannabis laws to improve and support health and wellness, ensure a lawful and well-regulated medical cannabis program, and to provide fiscal benefits to the Pueblo of Picuris and its tribal members. Section 12-1-3. Authority to Establish Medical Cannabis Program. (a) This Title hereby authorizes the Pueblo of Picuris to establish a Medical Cannabis Program to meet the medical needs of tribal members and qualified patients, and to ensure an adequate supply of medical cannabis for the number of patients in the registry, and to provide the right to use and possess cannabis for medical purposes when recommended by a medical provider who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the use of cannabis in the treatment of a debilitating medical condition. (b) In order to further the goals and to provide an additional source of governmental revenue, the Tribe has adopted this Title , which shall be liberally construed to fulfill the purposes for which it has been adopted. (c) The Medical Cannabis Program shall have an Executive Committee for administrative decision-making as specified herein, and to promulgate Program Rules as necessary, for adoption by the Tribal Council. (d) The Medical Cannabis Program shall hire a Program Manager to fulfill the administrative purposes and achieve program implementation who shall report to the Executive Committee for supervision. (e) Nothing in this Title shall be deemed to be in conflict with the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. section 801 et seq. or to otherwise permit any activity that is lawfully prohibited under that Act. (f) Nothing in this Title shall be deemed to create a right for individuals to grow and distribute cannabis. (g) Nothing in this Title shall be construed to (1) allow persons to engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance; (2) allow the diversion of medical cannabis to anyone other than the registered cardholder; (3) allow any activity relating to the cultivation, distribution, or consumption of cannabis that is otherwise illegal. (h) The Medical Cannabis Program shall operate to (1) prevent the distribution of cannabis to persons under 21 years of age; (2) prevent the revenue from the sale of cannabis from going where it is legal to other states; (4) prevent cannabis activity that is legal under this title from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of illegal drugs or other illegal activity; (5) prevent violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; (6) prevent drugged driving and the exacerabation of other adverse public health consequences associated with the use of cannabis; (7) prevent the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and (8) prevent the possession and use of cannabis on federal property. Section 12-1-4. Sovereign Immunity. (a) The Pueblo of Picuris hereby declares that it is immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. All tribal officials and employees, including members of the Tribal Council, and officers and directors of all federal and tribal corporations, acting within their scope of authority and within their scope of duty, are immune from suit for any acts of omissions, pursuant to this Title . (b) Nothing in this Title shall be construed to limit or waive the sovereign immunity of the Tribe, Tribal Council, or the Board of Directors of the Three Eagles, Inc. for any purpose, expressly or impliedly. (c) Tribal Corporations that are federally chartered, or chartered under tribal law, may negotiate limited waivers of sovereign immunity for purposes of doing business on tribal lands, pursuant to this Title . Section 12-1-5. Jurisdiction. (a) The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court retains general jurisdiction over all matters arising from this Medical Cannabis Code. (b) People who enter the tribal lands, or property, of the Pueblo of Picuris, shall be deemed to have consented to the civil jurisdiction of the Tribe. In additions, any person who utilizes this Medical Cannabis Code, in any manner, shall have consented to the civil jurisdiction of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court for any cause of action arising under this Title . Section 12-1-6. Taxation of Medical Cannabis. (a) The Pueblo of Picuris may impose a sales tax comparable to the State and local sales taxes on the sale of medical cannabis.

(c) Medical cannabis used in the course of medical treatments by a clinic, hospital, or similarly situated facility owned and operated by a federally recognized Indian tribe within its exterior boundaries may be exempted from taxation under the terms of this Title and federal Indian law. Section 12-1-7. Full Faith &amp; Credit; Comity. (a) The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Title (See 28 U.S.C. 1738) and the New Mexico Foreign Judgments Act (See NMSA 39-4A-3 1978) required the recognition and enforcement of Tribal Court Orders and Administrative Orders when doing so does not offend the public policy of the enforcing State. (b) The Pueblo of Picuris Medical Cannabis Registry Identification Cards are consistent with the laws and public policy of the State of New Mexico, who's Department of Health administers the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program pursuant to the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act. (c) Comity provides for a mechanism to be able to move formal orders across boundaries for uniformity and symmetry of policy between foreign nations and recognizes the rights of citizens and other persons under the laws of neighboring jurisdictions. (d) The Pueblo of Picuris Medical Cannabis Program shall coexist with the neighboring State of New Mexico in a stable regulatory framework of policies, guidelines, procedural protections and public health reforms.

Implied and Express Revocation of Wills. A. If after the making of a will, the testator marries or is divorced, or testator's marriage is annulled or dissolved, or a child is born to the testator, and no provision has been made in such will for such contingency, such marriage, divorce, annulment, dissolution, birth, or adoption of a minor child shall operate as revocation of such a will, provided such divorce, annulment, or dissolution shall not operate as a revocation of such will fi the spouse of the testator was not a beneficiary under this will. B.

A will is construed to pass all personal property which the testator owns at their death including personal property acquired after the execution of their will. (2) Beneficiary must survive testator by 120 hours. A beneficiary who does not survive the testator by 120 hours is treated as if they predeceased the testator, unless the testator's will contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths, including common disaster, or requiring that the beneficiary survive the testator or survive the testator for a stated period in order to take under the will; (3) Failure of testamentary provision. If a devise other than a residuary devise fails for any reason, it becomes part of the residual estate. If the residual estate is devised to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary beneficiaries fails for any reason, their share asses to the other residuary beneficiaries, or to other residuary beneficiaries in proportion to their interests in the residue. (4) Class gifts. One who would have been a beneficiary under a class gift if they had survived the testator is treated as a devisee for purposes of this section , regardless of whether their death occurred before or after the execution of the will. (5) Generic terms. Half-bloods, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gifts terminology and terms of relationships in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, but a person born out of wedlock is not treated as the child of the father unless the person is openly and notoriously so treated by the father or unless paternity has been judicially determined during the life of the father or in some other manner which satisfies the court by clear and convincing evidence that paternity has been conclusively established. (6) Ademption by Satisfaction. Property which a testator gave in their lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person in whole or in part only if the will provides for deduction of the lifetime gift, or the testator declares in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is to be deducted from the devise or is in satisfaction. For the purpose of partial satisfaction, property given during the lifetime is valued as of the time the beneficiary came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the decedent, whichever comes first.

CHAPTER 11 GUARDIANSHIP OF MINORS AND INCOMPETENTS Section 14-11-1. Purpose and Intent The applicability of this Chapter is only in those situations or circumstances where a minor child or mental incompetent required an appointment of a guardian of their person and/or property as the result of a will or intestate succession. This Chapter is not intended to provide a procedure for the appointment of a guardian that would be governed by Title 13. Pueblo of Picuris Elder and Vulnerable Adult Protection Code. Section 14-11-2. Definition of Guardian A. A guardian is an adult appointed by the Probate Judge to take care of the person or property of (1) a minor child with no surviving parent or; (2) a person adjudged to be an incompetent. The guardian must exercise the highest standard of care for the ward, and is subject to regulation by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court. B. The Probate Judge, when it appears necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and/or property of either children under the Court's jurisdiction or incompetents who have no guardian legally appointed by will or deed. Such appointment may be made on the petition of a relative or other person on behalf of the child or incompetent, or a petition of the child if at least fourteen (14) years of age. Before making such appointment, the Court must cause such notice as the Court deems reasonable to be given to any person having the care of a child, and to such other relatives of a child residing on the reservation as the Court may deem proper, and in cases of adult incompetents, the Court may cause notice to be given to the incompetent at least five (5) days before hearing the petition. C. If a child is under the age of fourteen (14) years, the Probate Judge may nominate or appoint their guardian. If the child is fourteen (14) years of age or older, the child may nominate their own guardian who, if approved by the Probate Judge, must be appointed accordingly If the guardian nominated by the child is not approved by the Probate Judge, or if the child resides outs of the Pueblo of Picuris, or if, after being duly cited by the Probate Judge, the child neglects for ten (10) days to nominate a suitable person, the Probate Judge may nominate and appoint the guardian in the same manner as if the child were under the age of fourteen (14) years. D. When a guardian has been appointed by the Probate Judge for a child under the age of fourteen (14) years, the child, at any time after the child attains that age, may nominate their own guardian, subject to the approval of the Probate Judge. A guardian appointed may as specified by the Probate Judge have the custody and care of the education of the child and the care and management of their property until such child arrives at the age of eighteen (18), marries, is emancipated by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court, or until the guardian is legally discharged, provided, however, that said guardian shall not have the authority, without express written consent of the Probate Judge, to dispose of any real or personal property of the child in any manner. Said guardian shall also have the authority to consent to the medical care and treatment of the child. E. the Probate Judge may order that the Probate Clerk disburse monthly reimbursement payments to the person or agency to whom custody is granted under this code, provided sufficient funds have been appropriated by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council. Said disbursements must be used by the person or agency with custody of the child for the sole purpose of covering expenses incurred in the care and custody of said child and shall not be used for any other purpose. The use of said funds for any purpose other than that described in this section shall subject said person or agency to contempt of Court and to any criminal and civil penalties or remedies provided by the Pueblo of Picuris Law and Order Code. Section 14-11-3. How Guardians are Appointed A. By will. The last surviving parent or spouse of a minor or mental incompetent may designate in a will the guardian for the minor or mental incompetent. Upon determination by the Probate Judge that the will is valid, and that the person designated is willing to accept the responsibilities of guardianship, the Probate Judge shall appoint the person designated; provided that for good cause show, the Probate Judge may decline to appoint the person designated. B. By Probate Judge appointment. Where a minor or mental incompetent is in need of a guardian, and no guardian is appointed pursuant to a valid will, the Probate Judge may appoint a guardian, to promote the best interests of the minor or mental incompetent. C. Hearing. In each case where a guardian is to be appointed, either by will, or by Probate Judge appointment, a hearing shall be held following notice to all interested parties. Section 14-11-4. Types of Guardianship The types of guardianship shall include guardianship of property and/or guardianship of the person. Guardianship of the person shall include both temporary or permanent guardianship. Section 14-11-5. Guardianship of Property The Probate Judge may appoint a guardian of the property of a child or incompetent person under such terms and conditions as the Probate Judge sets forth in the written order.

There shall be a presumption of continued permanent guardianship in order to provide stability for the child. Permanent guardianship shall only be terminated based upon the unsuitability of the permanent guardian(s) rather than the competency or suitability of the parent(s). The parent(s) and the child's extended family shall be granted liberal visitation rights unless deemed inappropriate by the Probate Judge. Section 14-11-7. Temporary Guardianship The Probate Judge may appoint a temporary guardian under such terms and conditions as the Probate Judge sets forth in the written order. A temporary guardianship may be terminated if the Probate Judge determines that it is in the best interests of the child to change custody from the temporary guardian to a new guardian or to return the child to the parent, guardian or custodian. The parent(s) and the child's extended family shall be granted liberal visitation rights unless deemed inappropriate by the Probate Judge. Section 14-11-8.

In the event that any guardian shall receive any money or funds of any child or incompetent person during their term of office as guardian, before taking and receiving into custody such money or funds, the Probate Judge must require of such person a bond with sufficient surety to be approved by the Probate Judge and in such sum as the Probate Judge shall order, conditioned that the guardian will faithfully execute the duties of their trust, and the following conditions shall form the part of such bond without being expressed therein: 1) To make an inventory of all the estate of the ward that comes into their possession or knowledge and to return the same within such time as the Probate Judge may order, and; 2) To dispose of and manage the estate according to law and for the best interests of the ward, and faithfully to discharge their trust in relation thereto, and also in relation to the care, custody and education of the ward, and; 3) To render an account on oath of the property, estate and money of the ward in their hand and all the proceeds or interests derived therefore, and of the management and disposition of the same, within three (3) months after their appointment, and at such other times as the Probate Judge directs, and at the expiration of their trust, to settle their accounts with the Probate Judge or with the ward if the ward is of full age, or their legal representative, and to pay over and deliver all the estate, monies and effects remaining in their hands, or due from them on such settlement to the person who is legally entitled thereto; 4) The funds of any child or incompetent must be used by their guardian solely for the support and education of such child and for the support of such incompetent, and shall be expended by the guardian in a reasonable manner according to the circumstances and station in life of such ward, and in such manner as can reasonable be afforded according to the income and estate of said ward; 5) If determined to be appropriate by the Probate Judge, the written order may set forth that the child's property may not be used for the child's care, but rather to be managed for the child until the child reached the age of eighteen (18) or is emancipated by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court. Section 14-11-12. Incompetent Persons A. In case of incompetent persons, if after a full hearing and examination upon such petition, and upon further proof by the certificates of at least two qualified physicians showing that any person is incompetent as defined in this Code, it appears to the Probate Judge that the person in question is not capable of taking care of him or herself and of managing their property, such Probate Judge must appoint a guardian of the person and estate within the powers and duties specified in this Part. B. Every guardian of an incompetent person appointed as provided herein has the care and custody of the person of their ward and the management of their estate until such guardian is legally discharged; the guardian must give bond to such ward in like manner and with like conditions as before specified with respect to the guardianship of a child. C. A person who has been declared incompetent, or the guardian, or any relative of such person within the third degree, or any friend, may apply by petition to the Probate Judge to have the fact of their restoration to capacity judicially determined. The petition shall be verified and shall state that such person is then competent. The Probate Judge shall require notice to be given of a hearing upon said petition at some date after said petition has been filed; and at the hearing upon said petition, witnesses shall be examined and a determination made by the Probate Judge as to whether the petition should be granted and the incompetent person be declared of sound mind and capable of taking care of him or herself and his or her property, their restoration to capacity shall be adjudged and the guardianship of such person, if such person shall be a child, shall cease. Section 14-11-13. Termination of Guardianship A. Upon motion of any person, or the Tribe, the Probate Judge may provide notice and a hearing on whether to terminate guardianship. Grounds for termination shall include, but not be limited to, personal use by the guardian of the assets of the ward, failure to provide a reasonable level of care for the ward, or the marriage of a minor ward. B. Guardianship, including guardians of the property of the ward, shall terminate automatically upon a minor reaching age eighteen (18), or upon a mental incompetent being adjudged by the Probate Judge to have regained legal capacity.", "num": "", "path": "library|Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Law and Order Code", "title": "Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Law and Order Code", "url": "/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code"}
