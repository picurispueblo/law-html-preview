                <p>The removal of a minor from his/her home for foster care placement, termination of parental rights and pre-adoption placement must result from a judicial determination that continuation would be contrary to the welfare of each minor. Reasonable efforts are to be made before foster care placement, termination of parental rights and pre-adoption placement to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the minor from his/her home and reasonable efforts are to be made for the minor's return to his/her home and removal is in the best interest of the minor. Nothing in this section prevents the emergency removal of a minor as allowed by the Children's Code, pursuant to Section 10.10.010.</p>
