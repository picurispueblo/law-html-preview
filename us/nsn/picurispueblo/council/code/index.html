                <p id="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#10/2/10-2-1"><span id="10/2/10-2-1"><span class="level-num">Section 10-2-1. </span></span>Best Interests of the Child.</p>
                <p>All actions and decisions made under the authority of this Code shall be implemented to serve the best interests of the child. In determining the best interests of the child the following principles govern:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="10/2/10-2-1A.">A.</span> A child's need for love, nurturing, protection and stability. A child must have a safe and nurturing home environment offering emotional support and comfort; the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter; reasonable medical care and protection from danger, violence, or exposure to harmful conduct including drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="10/2/10-2-1B.">B.</span> A child's need for family. A child must have connection to loving and caring family members for guidance and nurturing. Although not all children have the benefit of family care, nothing can replace the primary role of loving parents and family in a child's life.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="10/2/10-2-1C.">C.</span> A child's need for identity and development. A child must develop self-identity and awareness of his/her unique role within the larger community, including the child's cultural community. This is done by participation in cultural activities, speaking one's native language and having opportunities and encouragement to pursue education and enrichment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="10/2/10-2-1D.">D.</span> A child's need for happiness. A child cannot be happy unless his/her primary needs are met; but a child also needs opportunities for play and recreation, leisure time and other activities that the child enjoys, and possession of toys and other personal items of importance to the child.</p>
                <p id="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#10/2/10-2-2"><span id="10/2/10-2-2"><span class="level-num">Section 10-2-2. </span></span>Placement Priorities.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.">A.</span> Findings:  The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council hereby finds as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(1)">(1)</span> The increasing volume and variety of solid waste and hazardous waste being generated on the Pueblo of Picuris and the often-inadequate existing methods of managing solid waste and hazardous waste are creating conditions that threaten the public health, safety and welfare of tribal members and residents of the Pueblo of Picuris by contributing to land, air and water pollution, to the production of flies, rodents and litter, to the waste of dwindling natural resources, and to the general deterioration of the Pueblo of Picuris environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(2)">(2)</span> The people of the Pueblo of Picuris have a primary interest in the protection and control of the land and other natural resources affected by the improper disposal of solid waste within the Pueblo of Picuris, and the quality of such land and other natural resources must be protected to insure the health, economic, aesthetic and cultural well-being of the Pueblo of Picuris People.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(3)">(3)</span> Open dumping is particularly harmful to public health, contaminates surface and underground water resources, including drinking water from underground and surface supplies and pollutes the land, air and water of the Pueblo of Picuris.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(4)">(4)</span> Inadequate and environmentally unsound practices for the disposal or use of solid waste and hazardous waste have created greater amounts of soil, air and water pollution and other problems for public health and the environment on the Pueblo of Picuris. The traditional methods of solid waste and hazardous waste management may not meet future requirements for eliminating environmental pollution and conserving natural resources.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(5)">(5)</span> Pursuant to federal law as determined by the United States Supreme Court in such cases as Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981) and reaffirmed in the Strate v. A-1 Contractors    117 S. Ct. 1404 (1997), the Pueblo of Picuris possesses the inherent sovereign authority to regulate within its exterior boundaries solid waste disposal that affects fundamental tribal interests and public health and safety, including when such activities conducted by non-members of the Tribe on privately owned land within the exterior boundaries of Pueblo of Picuris.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(6)">(6)</span> Under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. Â§6903(13) (as part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), "Indian Tribe" is included within the definition of "municipality" for purposes of the Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(7)">(7)</span> Methods of solid waste management emphasizing source reduction, recovery and recycling of all solid waste are essential to the long-range preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the public, to the economic productivity of the Pueblo of Picuris, to the environmental quality of the Pueblo of Picuris and to the conservation of natural resources.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(8)">(8)</span> Disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste in or on the land without careful planning and management will present a danger to the public health and environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(9)">(9)</span> Methods are available to separate recoverable materials from solid waste. The recovery and conservation of such material can produce numerous benefits to the Pueblo of Picuris, including economic benefits in the way of savings realized by conserving material in order to reduce the value or quantity of materials that ultimately become solid waste.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(10)">(10)</span> It is in the best interests of the Pueblo of Picuris and the residents of the Pueblo of Picuris to establish and maintain a comprehensive integrated tribal solid waste management plan, the objectives which will be to manage and control solid waste and to prohibit the introduction of hazardous waste into the Pueblo of Picuris in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of tribal members; to preserve the environment; and to provide for the maximum reuse of the resources contained in solid waste.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2A.(11)">(11)</span> Such protection of the Pueblo of Picuris resources is not adequately provided for under existing legislation, and such protection will be furthered by the passage of, adoption and implementation of this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-2B.">B.</span> Purpose:    The general purposes of this Code are to:</p>
                <p>1)	finance, implement, regulate, and enforce environmental standards and criteria, orders, and permit conditions, and exercise comprehensive Tribal regulatory authority over all solid waste and hazardous waste disposal matters within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris;</p>

                <p>3)	prevent the deterioration of the environment and increase the standard of living, quality of life, health, safety and welfare of all persons within the exterior boundaries of the Pueblo of Picuris;</p>
                <p>4)	provide and promote Tribal environmental protection and services within the Pueblo of Picuris and to regulate environmental activities under principles of Tribal sovereignty; and</p>
                <p>5)	prevent air, water and land from solid and hazardous waste pollution, including contamination of the Tribe's aquifers, ground waters, surface waters, drinking water supplies and other natural resources.</p>

                <p id="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#11/1/11-1-13"><span id="11/1/11-1-13"><span class="level-num">Section 11-1-13. </span></span>Solid Waste Facility Sites</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="11/1/11-1-13(A)">(A)</span> Site Considerations.</p>
                <p>1)	Floodplains. If a solid waste disposal site or landfill is located within a 100 year floodplain, the owner or operator must demonstrate that the MSWLF will not restrict the flow of a 100 year flood, reduce temporary storage capacity of the floodplain or result in any washout of solid waste which would pose a hazard to human health or the environment.</p>
                <p>2)	Wetlands. "Wetlands" means those areas which are defined in 40 C.F.R. Â§232.2(r) and include, but are not limited to, swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas, and are defined as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency ad duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. No MSWLF shall be located in wetlands, unless the owner/operator can make the demonstrations as required under the Federal criteria set forth in 40 C.F.R. Â§258.12. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may, in its discretion, however, refuse to permit an MSWLF in any areas which are wetlands as defined herein.</p>
                <p>3)	Fault Areas. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located within 200 feet (60 meters) of a fault that has had displacement in Holocene time. For purposes of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#11/1/11-1-13" title="11-1-13 Solid Waste Facility Sites">this section</a>:</p>
                <p>a)	"Fault" means any fracture or a zone of fractures in any material along which strata on one side have been displaced with respect to that on the other side.</p>
                <p>b)	"Displacement" means the relative movement of two sides of a fault measured in any direction.</p>
                <p>c)	"Holocene" means the most recent epoch of the Quaternary period extending from the end of the Pleistocene Epoch to the present.</p>
                <p>4)	Seismic Impact Zone. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located in a seismic impact zone unless the owner/operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department, and the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department finds, that all containment structures including liners, leachate collection systems and surface water control systems, are designed to resist the maximum peak ground acceleration associated with the maximum credible earthquake. For purposes of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#11/1/11-1-13" title="11-1-13 Solid Waste Facility Sites">this Section</a>, "seismic impact zones" are defined as areas having a 10 percent or greater probability that the maximum expected horizontal acceleration in lithifield earth material, expressed as a percentage of the earth's gravitational pull (g), will exceed 0.10 g in 250 years.</p>
                <p>5)	Unstable Areas. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill shall be located in an unstable area. "Unstable area" means a location that is susceptible to natural or human-induced events or forces capable of impairing the integrity of some or all of the landfill structural components responsible for preventing releases from a landfill. Unstable areas can include poor foundation conditions, areas susceptible to mass movements, and Karst terrains.</p>
                <p>6)	Bodies of Water. No solid waste disposal site or landfill shall be located within 1,000 feet of a lake, pond, slough, river, stream, or other body of water. To the greatest extent possible, MSWLFs will be located substantially greater distances from any surface water of significance.</p>
                <p>7)	Adverse Impact. No MSWLF shall be located in a manner that will cause significant adverse impact to recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat or populations or Pueblo of Picuris aesthetics.</p>
                <p>8)	Dwellings. To the greatest extent possible, taking into account the requirements of this Ordinance, no MSWLF shall be located within 3,000 feet of a dwelling inhabited at the time the site is created.</p>
                <p>9)	Domestic Water Well. No solid waste disposal site or landfill shall be located within 2,000 feet of a domestic water well, unless the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines in writing that the well will not be contaminated by the site and establishes a water monitoring program for the well, or the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department provides a substitute source of equal or better convenience and quality.</p>

                <p>The financial assurance mechanism(s) must be obtained by the owner or operator before the initial receipt of waste in the case of closure and post-closure care cost estimates; and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Â§258.58, and maintained as required by 40 CFR Â§Â§258.71-74.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the actual financial assurance mechanism(s) and financial assurance agreements that is/are provided by the owner or operator. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may also require in its discretion, in addition to the criteria for financial assurance under 40 CFR Part 258, that an owner or operator provide financial assurance for corrective action for other than known releases as a condition for issuing an MSWLF permit.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall also require that liability and property damage insurance coverage be provided by an owner or operator for claims arising from personal injury or property damage, including any claims from releases from an MSWLF unit.</p>
                <p>If a trust fund mechanism is used, the trustee must be an entity who has the authority to act as a trustee, and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency. Trust fund payments must be made as specified in 40 CFRÂ§258.74 criteria. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the terms of any trust agreement which is to be used as a financial assurance mechanism. The trust agreement shall be irrevocable. Trust funds shall only be release to reimburse the owner or operator for closure, post-closure and corrective action costs actually incurred, but only if sufficient funds remain in the trust to cover the remaining costs.</p>
                <p>If any surety bond is used, the surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties in federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>

                <p>Pursuant to the sovereign authority of the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council, a federally recognized Tribe of Indians with the inherent authority to make laws to protect the political integrity, economic security, health, safety, and welfare of the Pueblo of Picuris and its tribal members.</p>

                <p>It is the policy of the Pueblo of Picuris to continue the traditional respect the members of the Pueblo of Picuris have had for elders. Elders are a valuable resource to the Pueblo of Picuris because they are repositories and custodians of tribal history, language, culture and tradition; and they are the best hope of the Pueblo of Picuris to pass on the tribal history, language, culture, and tradition to children of the Pueblo of Picuris. Thus, the interests of the Pueblo of Picuris, now and in the future, are advanced when its Elders can be confident they are protected from abuse, neglect, and exploitation and are free to fully participate in the activities and proceedings of the Pueblo of Picuris.</p>

The determination of how property is disposed upon a person's death is an exercise of self-governance crucial to tribal sovereignty.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="14/7/14-7-4B.(1)">(1)</span> All property; after-acquired property. A will is construed to pass all personal property which the testator owns at their death including personal property acquired after the execution of their will.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="14/7/14-7-4B.(2)">(2)</span> Beneficiary must survive testator by 120 hours. A beneficiary who does not survive the testator by 120 hours is treated as if they predeceased the testator, unless the testator's will contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths, including common disaster, or requiring that the beneficiary survive the testator or survive the testator for a stated period in order to take under the will;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="14/7/14-7-4B.(3)">(3)</span> Failure of testamentary provision. If a devise other than a residuary devise fails for any reason, it becomes part of the residual estate. If the residual estate is devised to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary beneficiaries fails for any reason, their share asses to the other residuary beneficiaries, or to other residuary beneficiaries in proportion to their interests in the residue.</p>

Half-bloods, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gifts terminology and terms of relationships in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, but a person born out of wedlock is not treated as the child of the father unless the person is openly and notoriously so treated by the father or unless paternity has been judicially determined during the life of the father or in some other manner which satisfies the court by clear and convincing evidence that paternity has been conclusively established.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="14/7/14-7-4B.(6)">(6)</span> Ademption by Satisfaction. Property which a testator gave in their lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person in whole or in part only if the will provides for deduction of the lifetime gift, or the testator declares in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is to be deducted from the devise or is in satisfaction. For the purpose of partial satisfaction, property given during the lifetime is valued as of the time the beneficiary came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the decedent, whichever comes first.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="14/11/14-11-2A.">A.</span> A guardian is an adult appointed by the Probate Judge to take care of the person or property of (1) a minor child with no surviving parent or; (2) a person adjudged to be an incompetent. The guardian must exercise the highest standard of care for the ward, and is subject to regulation by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="14/11/14-11-2B.">B.</span> The Probate Judge, when it appears necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and/or property of either children under the Court's jurisdiction or incompetents who have no guardian legally appointed by will or deed. Such appointment may be made on the petition of a relative or other person on behalf of the child or incompetent, or a petition of the child if at least fourteen (14) years of age. Before making such appointment, the Court must cause such notice as the Court deems reasonable to be given to any person having the care of a child, and to such other relatives of a child residing on the reservation as the Court may deem proper, and in cases of adult incompetents, the Court may cause notice to be given to the incompetent at least five (5) days before hearing the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="14/11/14-11-2C.">C.</span> If a child is under the age of fourteen (14) years, the Probate Judge may nominate or appoint their guardian. If the child is fourteen (14) years of age or older, the child may nominate their own guardian who, if approved by the Probate Judge, must be appointed accordingly If the guardian nominated by the child is not approved by the Probate Judge, or if the child resides outs of the Pueblo of Picuris, or if, after being duly cited by the Probate Judge, the child neglects for ten (10) days to nominate a suitable person, the Probate Judge may nominate and appoint the guardian in the same manner as if the child were under the age of fourteen (14) years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="14/11/14-11-2D.">D.</span> When a guardian has been appointed by the Probate Judge for a child under the age of fourteen (14) years, the child, at any time after the child attains that age, may nominate their own guardian, subject to the approval of the Probate Judge. A guardian appointed may as specified by the Probate Judge have the custody and care of the education of the child and the care and management of their property until such child arrives at the age of eighteen (18), marries, is emancipated by the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court, or until the guardian is legally discharged, provided, however, that said guardian shall not have the authority, without express written consent of the Probate Judge, to dispose of any real or personal property of the child in any manner. Said guardian shall also have the authority to consent to the medical care and treatment of the child.</p>

Said disbursements must be used by the person or agency with custody of the child for the sole purpose of covering expenses incurred in the care and custody of said child and shall not be used for any other purpose. The use of said funds for any purpose other than that described in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code#14/11/14-11-2" title="14-11-2 Definition of Guardian">this section</a> shall subject said person or agency to contempt of Court and to any criminal and civil penalties or remedies provided by the Pueblo of Picuris Law and Order Code.</p>
