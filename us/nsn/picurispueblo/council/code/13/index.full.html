                <p>It is the policy of the Pueblo of Picuris to continue the traditional respect the members of the Pueblo of Picuris have had for elders. Elders are a valuable resource to the Pueblo of Picuris because they are repositories and custodians of tribal history, language, culture and tradition; and they are the best hope of the Pueblo of Picuris to pass on the tribal history, language, culture, and tradition to children of the Pueblo of Picuris. Thus, the interests of the Pueblo of Picuris, now and in the future, are advanced when its Elders can be confident they are protected from abuse, neglect, and exploitation and are free to fully participate in the activities and proceedings of the Pueblo of Picuris.</p>
