                <p>Owners or operators of MSWLFs on the Pueblo of Picuris are required to comply with the financial assurance criteria under Subpart G of 40 CFR Part 258, which are incorporated herein and contained at 40 CFR §258.71 (Financial Assurance for Closure); 40 CFR§258-72 (Financial Assurance for Post-Closure Care); 40 CFR §258.73 (Financial Assurance for Corrective Action); and 40 CFR §258.74 (Allowable Mechanisms to Demonstrate Financial Assurance).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Financial Assurance for Closure.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator of an MSWLF must have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to close the largest area of each MSWLF unit ever requiring a final cover as required under 40 CFR §258.60 at any time during the active life in accordance with the closure plan. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the estimate has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The cost estimate must equal the cost of closing the largest area of an MSWLF unit ever requiring a final cover at any time during the active life when the extent and manner of its operation would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by its closure plan.</p>
                <p>During the active life of the MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must annually adjust the closure estimate for inflation.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must increase the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided, if changes to the closure plan or MSWLF unit conditions increase the maximum cost of closure at any time during the remaining active life. The owner or operator may reduce the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided under Section B herein, if the closure cost estimate exceeds the maximum cost of closure at any time during the remaining life of the MSWLF unit. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the justification for the reduction of the closure cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator of each MSWLF unit must establish financial assurance for closure of the MSWLF unit in compliance with 40 CFR §258.74. The owner or operator must provide continuous coverage for closure until released from financial assurance requirements by demonstrating compliance with 40 CFR §258.60(h) and (i).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Financial Assurance for Post-Closure Care.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must have a detailed estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to conduct post-closure care for the MSWLF unit in compliance with the post-closure plan developed under 40 CFR §258.61. The post-closure cost estimate used to demonstrate financial assurance must account for the total costs of conducting post-</p>
                <p>closure care, including annual and periodic costs as described in the post-closure plan over the entire post-closure care period. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the estimate has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The cost estimate for post-closure care must be based on the most expensive cost of post-closure care during the post-closure care period.</p>
                <p>During the active live of the MSWLF unit and during the post-closure care period the owner or operator must annually adjust the post-closure cost estimate for inflation.</p>
                <p>The owner operator must increase the post-closure care cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided if changes in the post-closure care plan or the MSWLF unit conditions increase the maximum cost of post-closure care. The owner or operator may reduce the post-closure care cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided if the cost estimate exceeds the maximum costs of the post-closure care remaining over the post-closure care period.	The  owner  or  operator  must  notify  the  Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the justification for the reduction of the post-closure care cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator of each MSWLF unit must establish financial assurance for the costs of post-closure care of the MSWLF unit in compliance with 40 CFR§258.74.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must provide continuous coverage and financial assurance for post- closure care until released from financial assurance requirements for post-closure care by demonstrating compliance with 40 CFR §258.61(e).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Financial Assurance for Corrective Action.</p>
                <p>An owner or operator of an MSWLF unit required to undertake a corrective action program under 40 CFR §258.58 must have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to perform the corrective action in accordance with the program required under 40 CFR §258.58. The corrective action cost estimate must account for the total costs of corrective action activities as described in the corrective action plan for the entire corrective action period. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the estimate has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must annually adjust the estimate for inflation until the corrective action program is completed in accordance with 40 CFR §258.58(f).</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must increase the corrective action cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided if changes in the corrective action program or MSWLD unit conditions increase the maximum cost of corrective action.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator may reduce the amount of the corrective action cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance provided if the cost estimate exceeds the maximum remaining costs of corrective action. The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the justification for any reduction of the corrective action cost estimate and the amount of financial assurance has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator of each MSWLF unit required to undertake a corrective action program under 40 CFR §258.58 must establish, in a manner in accordance with the 40 CFR</p>
                <p>§258.74, financial assurance for the most recent corrective action program. The owner or operator must provide continuous coverage and financial assurance for corrective action until released from financial assurance requirements for corrective action by demonstrating compliance with the 40 CFR §258.58(f) and (g).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Allowable Financial Mechanisms.</p>
                <p>40 CFR §258.74 required that an owner or operator of an MSWLF unit provide financial assurance to ensure that funds necessary to meet the costs of closure, post-closure care and corrective action for known release will be available in a timely fashion when they are needed. There are four mechanisms available to provide financial assurance, including a trust fund; a surety bond; a letter of cred; an insurance policy; or a combination of all four mechanisms. Any mechanism(s) that is/are used by an owner or operator must comply with all of the criteria in 40 CFR §258.74, which is incorporated by reference herein, and must be legally valid, binding and enforceable under state, federal and Tribal law.</p>
                <p>The financial assurance mechanism(s) must be obtained by the owner or operator before the initial receipt of waste in the case of closure and post-closure care cost estimates; and no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR §258.58, and maintained as required by 40 CFR §§258.71-74.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the actual financial assurance mechanism(s) and financial assurance agreements that is/are provided by the owner or operator. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may also require in its discretion, in addition to the criteria for financial assurance under 40 CFR Part 258, that an owner or operator provide financial assurance for corrective action for other than known releases as a condition for issuing an MSWLF permit.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall also require that liability and property damage insurance coverage be provided by an owner or operator for claims arising from personal injury or property damage, including any claims from releases from an MSWLF unit.</p>
                <p>If a trust fund mechanism is used, the trustee must be an entity who has the authority to act as a trustee, and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency. Trust fund payments must be made as specified in 40 CFR§258.74 criteria. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department must approve the terms of any trust agreement which is to be used as a financial assurance mechanism. The trust agreement shall be irrevocable. Trust funds shall only be release to reimburse the owner or operator for closure, post-closure and corrective action costs actually incurred, but only if sufficient funds remain in the trust to cover the remaining costs.</p>
                <p>If any surety bond is used, the surety company issuing the bond must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties in federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>
                <p>If any letter of credit is used, the issuing institution must be an entity which has the authority to issue letter of credit and whose letter of credit operations are regulated and examined by a federal agency.</p>
