                <p>The objective of the Probate Code is to provide for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned personal property on the Pueblo of Picuris. The Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council finds that probate procedure in the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Court is in the best interest of tribal members in that probate may be concluded more economically and more expeditiously than by other jurisdictions. The determination of how property is disposed upon a person's death is an exercise of self-governance crucial to tribal sovereignty.</p>
                <p>This Code shall be liberally construed and applied to meet the following objectives to ensure that the personal property of decedents passes to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries:</p>

A will is construed to pass all personal property which the testator owns at their death including personal property acquired after the execution of their will.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/picurispueblo/council/code/14.07.040#(b)(2)">(2)</span> Beneficiary must survive testator by 120 hours. A beneficiary who does not survive the testator by 120 hours is treated as if they predeceased the testator, unless the testator's will contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths, including common disaster, or requiring that the beneficiary survive the testator or survive the testator for a stated period in order to take under the will;</p>

If a devise other than a residuary devise fails for any reason, it becomes part of the residual estate. If the residual estate is devised to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary beneficiaries fails for any reason, their share asses to the other residuary beneficiaries, or to other residuary beneficiaries in proportion to their interests in the residue.</p>

One who would have been a beneficiary under a class gift if they had survived the testator is treated as a devisee for purposes of this section, regardless of whether their death occurred before or after the execution of the will.</p>

Half-bloods, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gifts terminology and terms of relationships in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, but a person born out of wedlock is not treated as the child of the father unless the person is openly and notoriously so treated by the father or unless paternity has been judicially determined during the life of the father or in some other manner which satisfies the court by clear and convincing evidence that paternity has been conclusively established.</p>

Property which a testator gave in their lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person in whole or in part only if the will provides for deduction of the lifetime gift, or the testator declares in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is to be deducted from the devise or is in satisfaction. For the purpose of partial satisfaction, property given during the lifetime is valued as of the time the beneficiary came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the decedent, whichever comes first.</p>
