                <p>The owner or operator of an MSWLF which has received solid waste after October   9, 1991, shall install a final cover system that is designed to minimize  infiltration and  erosion in compliance with 40 CFR §258.60.</p>
                <p>The final cover system as set forth in 40 CFR §258.60(a) must be comprised of an erosion layer underlain by an infiltration layer as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The infiltration layer must be comprised of a minimum of 18 inches of earthen material that has a permeability of less than or equal to the permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils present, or a permeability no greater than 1 x 10-5 cm/sec, whichever is less; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The erosion layer must consist of a minimum of 6 inches of earthen material that is capable of sustaining native plant growth.</p>
                <p>If EPA approves the Tribe's solid waste program, then the Pueblo of Picuris Environment  Department  may  approve  an  alternative  final  cover  design  under  40  CFR §258.60(b) that includes:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> An infiltration layer that achieves an equivalent reduction in infiltration as the infiltration layer specified in §258.60(a)(1); and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> An erosion layer that provides equivalent protection from wind and water erosion as the erosion layer specified in §258.60(a)(2). This alternative final cover design may not be applied to landfills which ceased to receive solid waste on or after October 9, 1993.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must prepare a written closure plan that describes the steps necessary to close an MSWLF unit at any point during its active life in accordance with the cover design requirements.	The closure plan, at  a minimum,  must  include   the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A description of the final cover and the methods and procedures to be used to install the cover;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> An estimate of the largest area of the MSWLF unit ever requiring a final cover at any time during the active life;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> An estimate of the maximum inventory of wastes ever on-site over the active life of the landfill facility; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> A schedule for completing all activities necessary to satisfy the closure criteria  in §258.60.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that a closure plan has been prepared and placed in the operating record by the date of the first receipt of solid waste.</p>
                <p>Prior to beginning closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that a notice of intent to close the unit has been placed in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator must begin closure activities of each MSWLF unit no later than 30 days after the date on which the MSWLF unit receives the known final receipt of wastes or, if the MSWLF unit has remaining capacity and there is a reasonable likelihood that the MSWLF unit will receive additional wastes, no later than one year after the most recent receipt of waste. Extensions beyond the one-year deadline for beginning closure may be granted by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program, and if the owner or operator demonstrates that the MSWLF unit has the capacity to receive additional wastes and the owner or operator has taken and will continue to take all steps necessary to prevent threats to human health and the environment from the unclosed MSWLF unit.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator of any MSWLF unit must complete closure activities of each MSWLF unit in accordance with the closure plan within 180 days following the beginning of closure as specified in 40 CFR §258.60(f). Extensions of the closure period may be granted by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department, if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program, and if the owner or operator demonstrates that closure will, of necessity, take longer than 180 days and he/she has taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent threats to human health and the environment from the unclosed MSWLF unit.</p>
                <p>Following the closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must supply the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department with a certification signed by an independent registered professional engineer that verifies that closure has been completed in accordance with the closure plan, an shall place such certification in the operating record.</p>
                <p>The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall take whatever action is reasonably necessary in perpetuity to notify any potential users or purchasers of the landfill facility property that the land has been used as a landfill facility and that its use is restricted under 40 CFR §258.61(c)(3). Post-closure use of the property shall not disturb the integrity of the site, final cover, liner(s) or monitoring systems, unless necessary to comply with requirements under 40 CFR Part 258.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Post Closure Care Requirement for MSWLFs</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> Following closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must conduct post- closure care. Post-closure care must be conducted for thirty (30) years, except as provided under Paragraph B of this section, and must include the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(i)(1)">(1)</span> Maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of any final cover, including making repairs to the cover as necessary to correct the effects of settlement, subsidence, erosion, or other events, and preventing run-on and run-off from eroding or otherwise damaging the final cover; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> Maintaining and operating the leachate collection system in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR §258.40. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may allow the owner or operator to stop managing leachate if the owner or operator demonstrates that leachate no longer poses a threat to human health and the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(i)(3)">(3)</span> Monitoring the ground water in accordance with the requirements of Subpart E of 40 CFR Part 258 and maintaining the groundwater monitoring system; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(i)(4)">(4)</span> Maintaining and operating the gas monitoring system in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR §258.23.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> The length of the post-closure care period may be:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> Decreased by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program and if the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department that the reduced period is sufficient to protect human health and the environment; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> Increased by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department determines that the lengthened period is necessary to protect human health and the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> The owner or operator of an MSWLF unit must prepare a written post-closure plan that includes, at a minimum, the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> A description of the monitoring and maintenance activities required in 40 CFR § 258.61(a) for each MSWLF unit, and the frequency at which the activities will be performed; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> The name, address and telephone number of the person or office to contact about the facility during the post-closure period; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(k)(3)">(3)</span> A description of the planned uses of the property during the post-closure period. Post-closure use of the property shall not disturb the integrity of the final cover, liner(s), or any other components of the containment system, or the function of the monitoring systems unless necessary to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 258. The Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may, if the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste plan, approve any other disturbance if the owner or operator demonstrates that disturbance of the final cover, liner or other component of the containment system, including any removal of waste, will not increase the potential threat to human health or the environment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> The owner or operator must notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department  that  a post-closure plan has been prepared and placed  in  the operating record prior  to the initial receipt of waste by the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> Following completion of the post-closure care period for each MSWLF unit, the owner or operator must  supply the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department with   a certification signed by an independent registered professional engineer which verifies that all post-closure care has been completed in accordance with the post- closure plan, and shall place such certification in the operating record.</p>
