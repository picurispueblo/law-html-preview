                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Applicability of Standards: This Ordinance shall apply to all MSWLFs and to all equipment  used  at  disposal  facilities  on  the  Pueblo  of Picuris.   In  addition,  40 CFR §§258.20 through 258.29 are incorporated by reference herein. All owner/operators of MSWLFs shall comply with Part 258 Criteria, in addition to any additional waste management operating criteria specified in this Ordinance, rules or regulations, or in any conditions in the MSWLF facility operation permit, or in guidance documents, or in orders of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Prohibition on Hazardous Waste: The receipt, acceptance, handling, storage, processing or disposal of hazardous waste at any MSWLF for disposal on the Pueblo of Picuris is prohibited, provided that the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may establish a program for collection, transfer, storage, transportation and disposal of the Pueblo of Picuris of hazardous waste generated or found on the Pueblo of Picuris. If an operator knows or has reason to believe hazardous waste has been received at a solid waste disposal facility, the operator shall notify the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department within two (2) hours of discovery of such waste. The owner or operator of a solid waste disposal facility shall implement a program to detect and prevent receipt, acceptance, handling, storage, processing or disposal of hazardous waste. This program must include at a minimum:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Random inspections of incoming loads;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Inspection of suspicious loads;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Maintenance records of inspections;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Training of personnel to recognize hazardous waste;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> Containment vessels shall be in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 112, SPCC Rule; (Spill Prevention, Containment and Counter Measures Rule) and;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> Procedures for notifying the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department if hazardous waste is discovered at the facility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Design: The uniform design criteria for MSWLFs contained in 40 CFR §258.40 are incorporated by reference for new MSWLFs. If the EPA has not approved the Tribe's solid waste program, then no new MSWLF units or lateral expansions shall be constructed unless they comply with Part 258 uniform design criteria, which includes a composite liner and a leachate system as set forth in 40 CFR §258.40(a)(2).</p>
                <p>If the EPA has approved the Tribe's solid waste program, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may approve the design criteria for an MSWLF, on a site-specific basis, in accordance with 40 CFR §258.40(a)(1).</p>
                <p>If the Tribe does not have and EPA approved solid waste program, then the uniform design criteria in 40 CFR §258.40(a)(2) shall apply as follows, unless the Pueblo of Picuris Environment  Department  determines  that  the  small  landfill exemption under  40 CFR §258.1(f)(1) applies, and that an MSWLF unit is exempt from the design criteria under Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 258.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> There must be a composite liner, as defined in paragraph (2) below, and a leachate collection system that is designed and constructed to maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachate over the liner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> "Composite liner" means a system consisting of two components; the upper component must consist of a minimum 30 mil flexible membrane liner (FML), and the lower component must consist of at least a two-foot layer of compacted soil with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 x 10' cm/sec. FML components consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) shall be at least 60-mil thick. The FML component must be installed in direct and uniform contact with the compacted soil component.</p>
                <p>If the EPA has approved the Tribe's solid waste program, then the design performance criteria in this section applies, and a composite liner and leachate collection system are not required, but the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department may require the same in his/her discretion.</p>
                <p>If the Tribe has an EPA approved solid waste program, or an MSWLF unit is determined to be exempt from Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 258, then the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department in approving an alternative design for an MSWLF, must consider at least the following factors:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The hydrogeologic characteristics of the facility and surrounding land; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> The climatic factors of the area; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the leachate.</p>
                <p>In addition, any site-specific design must ensure that the concentration values for chemicals listed in Table 1 of 40 CFR Part 258, which is incorporated by reference herein, will not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer at the relevant point of compliance, as specified in 40 CFR §258.40 (d) as follows:</p>
                <p>The relevant point of compliance specified by the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall be no more than 150 meters from the waste management unit boundary and shall be located on land owned by the owner of the MSWLF unit. In determining the relevant point of compliance the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall consider at least the following factors:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> The hydrogeologic characteristics of the facility surrounding land;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(7)">(7)</span> The volume and physical and chemical characteristics of the leachate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(8)">(8)</span> The quantity, quality and direction of flow of ground water;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(9)">(9)</span> The proximity and withdrawal rate of the groundwater users;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(10)">(10)</span> The availability of alternative drinking water supplies;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(11)">(11)</span> The existing quality of the ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impacts on the ground water and whether the ground water is currently used or reasonably expected to be used for drinking water.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(12)">(12)</span> Public health, safety and welfare effects; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(13)">(13)</span> Practicable capability of the owner/operator.</p>
                <p>The design of an MSWLF site shall also be based on the service area, anticipated nature and quantity of solid waste to be received, adjacent land uses, number and type of vehicles anticipated to enter the disposal facility site, whether the facility will be used by the general public, ground and surface  water,  leachate control, soils, drainage, provisions for monitoring, venting, controlling and possible use of disposal facility decomposition gases and other pertinent information. The owner or operator shall design the disposal facility to maximize the protection of public health.</p>
                <p>The MSWLF design shall include one or more proposed ultimate uses of the site or the intent to develop the site as open space graded to harmonize with the setting and landscape of native shrubbery or low-maintenance ground cover.</p>

The owner or operator shall maintain adequate records regarding length and depth of any cuts made in natural terrain where fill will be placed, together with the depth to the groundwater table. The owner or operator shall also adequately record other cuts that may affect the safe and proper operation of the disposal facility or cause damage to adjoining properties.</p>
                <p>The owner or operator shall maintain a log of the following: fires, earthslides, unusual or sudden settlement, personal injury, property damage, accidents, explosions, deliveries or discharge of hazardous waste or other materials not permitted at the disposal facility site, flooding, vandalism, contamination, pollution and other unusual occurrences. The owner or operator shall maintain inspection records, training procedures and notification procedures required herein. The owner or operator shall record and permanently maintain closure and post-closure maintenance plans as required by this Ordinance, any cost estimates and financial assurance documentation and information demonstrating compliance with the small community exemption as required by 40 CFR §258.1(f)(2).</p>
                <p>Disposal facility records shall be open to inspection by authorized representatives of the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department, and other regulatory and enforcement agencies during normal business hours. If information is identified as proprietary or confidential pursuant to this Ordinance, the Pueblo of Picuris Environment Department shall treat it as such.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Personnel: The owner or operator shall provide adequate numbers of qualified personnel to staff the disposal facility and deal effectively and promptly with matters of operation, maintenance, environmental controls, records, emergencies, and health and safety.
