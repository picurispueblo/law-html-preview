                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> An identification of the responsibilities of other Tribal agencies and entities involved in the implementation of the Tribe's solid waste disposal program and the distribution of federal and state funds to the Tribal authorities responsible for development and implementation of the Tribe's solid waste disposal program;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> A review of Tribal regulatory systems which are necessary to implement the Tribe's solid waste disposal program and enforce the Ordinance and rules or regulations promulgated hereunder;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> A study of how solid waste will be disposed of on or off the Pueblo of Picuris, in compliance with the Part 258 Criteria, including an assessment of costs for constructing and operating MSWLFs, or transfer stations on the Pueblo of Picuris and an assessment of costs for the collection and transportation of solid waste on or off the Pueblo of Picuris.</p>
                <p>The Plan may also include any other matters which are relevant for the Tribe's solid waste disposal program.</p>
                <p>The Committee shall submit the Plan to the Pueblo of Picuris Tribal Council, in writing, for its review, modification and approval.</p>
